In a city that can be hectic and fast-paced, outlets for physical activities are important &ndash; and although it is well-known that walking is the unofficial sport of Manhattan, more exciting diversions are available. As the largest park in the city, Central Park is a natural choice for residents and visitors who want to unwind with organized or unofficial sports.</p>\r\n<table style="margin: 0 0 10px 5px;" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" bgcolor="#ffffff">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style="text-align: left; "><a class="noHoverBg" style="line-height: 0;" href="/guide/sports/baseball-and-softball/field-finder.html"> <img src="http://www.centralpark.com/updata/field_finder.gif" border="0" alt="CentralPark.com Field Finder" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="225" height="54" /> </a></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>Young players can enjoy Central Park''s youth sports, such as soccer. The Central Park Conservancy offers soccer clinics to its youth members, and two fields on the <a title="Great Lawn" href="http://www.centralpark.com/guide/attractions/great-lawn.html">Great Lawn</a> are used by city youth teams. There are plenty of unorganized sport activities for children to enjoy in Central Park, as well. The park&rsquo;s wide open spaces are ideal for games of catch, soccer scrimmages, and Frisbee. Children can take lessons through the Central Park Conservancy at the park''s North Meadow Recreation Center.</p>\r\n<p>Even in the winter, Central Park offers many options for New York City residents and visitors to get active. During the winter, the <a title="Lasker" href="http://www.centralpark.com/guide/attractions/lasker-pool-rink.html">Lasker</a> facility turns from a pool into a skating rink. Manhattan residents who are daily walkers or runners can be seen in almost any weather enjoying the landscapes of Central Park, especially when the trees are capped with snow. Some Central Park locations are optimal for sledding &ndash; an activity not often associated with city life. For those in search of an aerobic workout with beautiful views, cross-country skiing may be of interest &ndash; the Sheep Meadow is one popular spot for this classic winter sport.</p>\r\n<p>New Yorkers looking for a little healthy competition can visit the many facilities around the park dedicated to organized sports. Some spots are available on a first-come, first-served basis, while others require reservations. The handball courts at the North Meadow Recreation Center are open for games; also in the park are basketball courts, baseball diamonds, and tennis courts. Adventurous Central Park visitors can try bouldering, an off-the-beaten-path sport that involves scaling massive rocks.</p>\r\n{{ADSPACE_300_250}}\r\n<p>Central Park features a host of sports-like activities that are suitable for people of any physical ability. Low-impact yoga is available at locations in the park; classes vary in style from relaxed and restorative to challenging and aerobic. For those who prefer spectator sports, model boat racing at Central Park''s Conservatory Water is a longstanding city tradition. Fishing is available at the <a title="Harlem Meer" href="http://www.centralpark.com/guide/attractions/harlem-meer.html">Harlem Meer</a>, though all fish caught must be released. Even chess, a challenging workout for the mind, can be found at 64th Street in the park. Bird watching is available to individuals; however, <a title="guided tours" href="http://www.centralpark.com/guide/tours.html">guided tours</a> may provide the best viewing opportunities.</p>\r\n<p>Because of its status as Manhattan''s backyard, Central Park is often the site of large sporting activities. In 2010, a large, public yoga class was held on the Great Lawn, with thousands in attendance.

A public park, they argued, would offer their own families an attractive setting for carriage rides and provide working-class New Yorkers with a healthy alternative to the saloon. After three years of debate over the park site and cost, in 1853 the state legislature authorized the City of New York to use the power of eminent domain to acquire more than 700 acres of land in the center of Manhattan.</p>\r\n<p>An irregular terrain of swamps and bluffs, punctuated by rocky outcroppings, made the land between Fifth and Eighth avenues and 59th and 106th streets undesirable for private development. Creating the park, however, required displacing roughly 1,600 poor residents, including Irish pig farmers and German gardeners, who lived in shanties on the site. At Eighth Avenue and 82nd Street, Seneca Village had been one of the city''s most stable African-American settlements, with three churches and a school. The extension of the boundaries to 110th Streetin 1863 brought the park to its current 843 acres.</p>\r\n<p>The question of who should exercise political control of this new kind of public institution was a point of contention throughout the nineteenth century. In appointing the first Central Park Commission (1857-1870), the Republican-dominated state legislature abandoned the principle of "home rule" in order to keep the park out of the hands of locally-elected (and primarily Democratic) office holders. Under the leadership of Andrew Green, the commission became the city''s first planning agency and oversaw the laying out of uptown Manhattan as well as the management of the park. After a new citycharter in 1870 restored the park to local control, the mayor appointed park commissioners.</p>\r\n{{ADSPACE_300_250}}\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><center style="page-break-after: always;"></center></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In 1857, the Central Park Commission held the country''s first landscape design contest and selected the "<a href="page.php?pid=381">Greensward Plan</a>," submitted by <strong><a href="page.php?pid=385">Frederick Law Olmsted</a></strong>, the park''s superintendent at the time, and <a href="page.php?pid=379"><strong>Calvert Vaux</strong></a>, an English-born architect and former partner of the popular landscape gardener, Andrew Jackson Downing. The designers sought to create a pastoral landscape in the English romantic tradition. Open rolling meadows contrasted with the picturesque effects of the Ramble and the more formal dress grounds of the Mall (Promenade) and Bethesda Terrace. In order to maintain a feeling of uninterrupted expanse, Olmsted and Vaux sank four Transverse Roads eight feet below the park''s surface to carry cross-town traffic. Responding to pressure from local critics, the designers also revised their plan''s circulation system to separate carriage drives, pedestrian walks, and equestrian paths. Vaux, assisted by Jacob Wrey Mould, designed more than forty bridges to eliminate grade crossings between the different routes.</p>\r\n<p>The building of Central Park was one of nineteenth-century New York''s most massive public works projects. Some 20,000 workers--Yankee engineers, Irish laborers, German gardeners, and native-born stonecutters--reshaped the site''s topography to create the pastoral landscape. After blasting out rocky ridges with more gunpowder than was later fired at the Battle of Gettysburg, workers moved nearly 3 million cubic yards of soil and planted more than 270,000 trees and shrubs. The city also built the curvilinear reservoir immediately north of an existing rectangular receiving reservoir. The park first opened for public use in the winter of 1859 when thousands of New Yorkers skated on lakes constructed on the site of former swamps. By 1865, the park received more than seven million visitors a year. The city''s wealthiest citizens turned out daily for elaborate late-afternoon carriage parades. Indeed, in the park''s first decade more than half of its visitors arrived in carriages, costly vehicles that fewer than five percent of the city''s residents could afford to own. Middle-class New Yorkers also flocked to the park for winter skating and summer concerts on Saturday afternoons. Stringent rules governing park use--for example, a ban on group picnics--discouraged many German and Irish New Yorkers from visiting the park in its first decade. Small tradesmen were not allowed to use their commercial wagons for family drives in the park, and only school boys with a note from their principal could play ball on the meadows. New Yorkers repeatedly contested these rules, however, and in the last third of the century the park opened up to more democratic use. In the 1880s, working-class New Yorkers successfully campaigned for concerts on Sunday, their only day of rest. Park commissioners gradually permitted other attractions, from the Carousel and goat rides to tennis on the lawns and bicycling on the drives. The Zoo, first given permanent quarters in 1871, quickly became the park''s most popular feature.</p>\r\n<p><center style="page-break-after: always;"></center></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In the early twentieth century, with the emergence of immigrant neighborhoods at the park''s borders, attendance reached its all time high. Progressive reformers joined many working-class New Yorkers in advocating the introduction of facilities for active recreation. In 1927, August Heckscher donated the first equipped playground, located on the southeastern meadow. When plans were announced to drain the old rectangular reservoir at the park''s center, Progressives urged than it be replaced by a sports arena, swimming pool, and playing fields. Other New Yorkers, influenced by the City Beautiful movement, proposed introducing a formal civic plaza and promenade that would connect the two museums at the park''s east and west borders. Landscape architects and preservationists campaigned against these design innovations, however, and the site of the reservoir was naturalistically landscaped into the Great Lawn. Such debates over modifications of the Greensward Plan and proper uses of a public park have persisted into the present.</p>\r\n<p>In 1934, Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia placed Robert Moses in charge of a new centralized citywide park system. During his twenty-six year regime, Moses introduced many of the facilities advocated by the progressive reformers. With the assistance of federal money during the Depression, Moses built 20 playgrounds on the park''s periphery, renovated the Zoo, realigned the drives to accommodate automobiles, added athletic fields to the North Meadow, and expanded recreational programming. In the early 1950s and early 1960s, private benefactors contributed the Wollman Skating Rink, the Lasker Rink and Pool, new boathouses, and the Chess and Checkers house. Moses also introduced permanent ball fields to the Great Lawn for corporate softball and neighborhood little league teams.</p>\r\n<p><center style="page-break-after: always;"></center></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In the 1960s, Mayor John Lindsay''s two park commissioners, Thomas Hoving and August Heckscher, welcomed "happenings," rock concerts, and be-ins to the park, making it a symbol of both urban revival and the counterculture. In the 1970s, however, severe budget cuts during a fiscal crisis, a long-term decline in maintenance, and the revival of the preservation movement prompted a new approach to managing the park. In 1980, the Central Park Conservancy, a private fundraising body, took charge of restoring features of the Greensward Plan, including the Sheep Meadow, the Bethesda Terrace, and the Belvedere Castle(designed by Vaux and Mould). From 1980 to 1996, the Central Park Conservancy was led by Elizabeth Barlow Rogers, who was also appointed the Central Park Administrator; in 1996, Karen Putnam assumed the dual private and public posts. By 1990, the private organization of the Central Park Conservancy contributed more than half the public park''s budget and exercised substantial influence on decisions about its future. Central Park, however, continues to be shaped by the public that uses it, from the joggers, disco roller skaters, and softball leagues to bird watchers and nature lovers.</p>\r\n<p>The previous entry on "Central Park" is excerpted from The Encyclopedia of New York City, edited by Kenneth T.

Now, to start with, a few general tips:</p>\r\n<p>New Yorkers are a naturally cheerful, helpful people. They are generally happy to be of assistance. Just speak slowly, don''t make any sudden moves and never go near them while they''re feeding. They can smell fear. They are also impressed if you at least try to speak their language. The trick is to figure out what that might be.</p>\r\n<p>Taxes: There is no VAT tax or other indirect tax. You will be subjected to the City''s 8.25% non-refundable sales tax and the 13.5% hotel tax. And you will like it.</p>\r\n<p>Tip Guide: In New York, like the rest of the U.S., gratuities are not included in the service check. Waiters, waitresses and bartenders can receive from 15 to 20 %, Taxis: 15% of fare, bellhops: $1 per bag, coat check: $1 per coat. <strong>Don''t pretend you don''t know.</strong> This insures good service, good karma and good vibrations. <br /><br />NYC supports over 150 museums, each open to the public.

Sightseeing is not a fashion show - wear comfortable shoes.</p>\r\n<p>You may rent bicycles and skates in and around Central Park.

The terrace was one of the very first structures to have been built in Central Park; its construction began in 1859, continued throughout the Civil War, and was completed in 1863.</p>\r\n<p>The structure''s layout consists of both an upper and a lower terrace, which are connected by two grand staircases and a smaller one leading directly to the <a href="page.php?pid=51">Mall</a>. The entire terrace is constructed primarily of New Brunswick sandstone, paved with Roman brick, and boasts granite steps and landings. While the upper terrace flanks 72nd street and is responsible for the amazing views witnessed by tourists every year, the lower terrace connects to the Mall and features the majestic <a href="page.php?pid=163">Bethesda Fountain</a>.</p>\r\n{{ADSPACE_300_250}}\r\n<p>When designing the terrace, both <a href="page.php?pid=385">Frederick Law Olmsted</a> and <a href="page.php?pid=379">Calvert Vaux</a> agreed that nature, rather than architecture, was to be of paramount importance in their plan. They proposed that the terrace would be known as the "<em>heart of the park,</em>" and Vaux was once quoted as having said, "<em>Nature first, second, and third &ndash; architecture after a while.</em>"  The two creators'' vision consisted of a place where people could experience nature while holding social gatherings, a place to see and be seen while mingling with like-minded people. It was meant to be an escape from the often stressful and busy urban life of the typical city-dweller.</p>\r\n<p><span>Jacob Wrey Mould, the designer of the Bethesda Fountain,</span>&nbsp;supported Olmsted and Vaux''s emphasis on nature with his designs of the decorative elements of the terrace, created according to Vaux''s own original ideas and concept. Mould''s carvings depict such things as the times of day and the four seasons. His designs also present images of birds that can be found in the area, as well as seasonal plants that are grown within the terrace.</p>\r\n<p>The Bethesda Terrace has experienced many changes throughout the decades. In the 1960''s its function aligned with its creators'' intention as a place of social gathering and it even featured a restaurant.  In the 1970''s however, the terrace was used primarily for drug-trafficking before it was restored by the <a href="page.php?pid=157">Central Park Conservancy</a> in the early 1980''s.

At first, the Carousel was not received positively; the park commissioners objected to having commercial enterprises in the park. However, since it was such a success, they eventually realized the potential value of the ride&rsquo;s revenue. Since then, there have been four different models on the site, each of which has served as a pastime in Central Park.&nbsp;</p>\r\n{{ADSPACE_300_250}}\r\n<p>A favorite of park-goers, the first Carousel remained in operation until 1924. It was powered by a mule and horse who walked in a hidden compartment underground below the attraction. The animals were trained to start and stop with a foot tap from the ride&rsquo;s operator above ground.</p>\r\n<p><span>The next two Carousels in the park were steam-powered and both destroyed by fire. In 1950, the Department of Parks and Recreation began to search for a replacement model and they found one abandoned in an old trolley terminal in Brooklyn&rsquo;s Coney Island. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>Originally crafted in 1908 by Solomon Stein and Harry Goldstein, the current Carousel is one of the nation''s largest merry-go-rounds, featuring 57 hand-carved horses and two decorative chariots. While still in working condition, it is over 100 years old and has undergone many rounds of repair and maintenance. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>In 1982, a donation from Alan and Katherine Stroock went to the cause and the Central Park Conservancy also restored the surrounding area and plaza with an upgrade in 1990.&nbsp; Currently, the organization is still working to make sure each individual horse is also restored.</span></p>', 'The Carousel is one of Central Park''s most famous attractions.

After its excavation in 1857, the Lake was opened for its first winter of ice-skating in 1858.  Until 1950, the Lake was used for ice-skating during the winter months and boating in the summer.  After 1950, however, the skating rink was officially closed, allowing the Lake''s former wildlife inhabitants to take up residence there once more.  As such, the Lake is now an excellent location for bird watching, where one can spot swans, ducks, and even the occasional egret or heron.</p>\r\n{{ADSPACE_300_250}}\r\n<p>The second largest man-made body of water in the Park, the Lake provides wonderful opportunities for viewing its abundant flora and fauna from rowboats, which are available for rent during the spring and summer months at the Loeb Boathouse. Aside from taking a boat, other options for nature sightseeing include taking a Venetian-style gondola ride around the Lake, or simply walking along the shore.</p>\r\n<p>Like many other Park attractions, the Lake was also restored by the Central Park Conservancy. It was reopened to visitors in 2008.

Two of these obelisks were constructed, and, around 13 or 12BC, they were transported from Heliopolis to Alexandria.  The pair was separated in the late 19th century; one was sent to London and another to New York City, both by the Khedive of Egypt in exchange for aid in modernizing his country.</p>\r\n<p>The Obelisk''s move to New York City was nothing short of arduous.  Once in the City, it took laborers four months to simply move it from the Hudson River to Central Park where it now stands, located behind the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p>\r\n<p>The Obelisk is known as the oldest man-made construction in Central Park.  Its shaft is 71 feet high and weighs about 200 tons.  Each corner of the Obelisk''s base is supported by huge, 900 pound bronze replicas of sea crabs originally created by the Romans while it was in Alexandria.  Each year visitors come to marvel at this piece of history, officially designated a scenic landmark in 1974 by the NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission.</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0px 0px 20px; text-align: left;"><span style="background-color: #efefef; color: green;">{{ADSPACE_300_250}}</span></p>\r\n<p>The Obelisk was a gift from Egypt to Central Park in 1881. &nbsp;Since then it has been the tallest structure and one of the most popular tourists sights in Central Park. &nbsp;In 2011, the Egyptian government threated to take back the Obelisk due to neglect. It took three years of planning and&nbsp;$500,000, (an amount that was raised privately by the Central Park Conservancy), to remove 3500 years of grime.&nbsp;The&nbsp;deterioration of the obelisk&nbsp;had less to do with conditions in New York City than the fact that, at some point in its history, it had toppled over and lay in desert sands for 500 years.</p>\r\n<p>After a year of renovation, which included using lasers to remove the dirt and grime, as well as glue, to&nbsp;fix sections that have become weak with age, the needle is open again for all to visit.&nbsp;The laser cleaning was not meant to bring the stone back to its pristine color, but to remove atmospheric deposition, along with damage that was done when it first arrived in Central Park.</p>\r\n<p>The monument underwent a restoration that did as much harm as good back in the 1880''s. &nbsp;Workers coated the entire structure in paraffin, which did preserve the surface. But first they cleaned a little too aggressively, scraping off an estimated 700 pounds of granite. When the obelisk arrived in New York, it was exposed to cold for the first time, which did not help its condition.</p>\r\n<p>Prior to this restoration, The Central Park Conservancy and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, worked closely together. &nbsp;The obelisk was extensively documented. Photographers from the Met created a detailed record of its condition, capturing every crack and crevice from the vantage of a boom lift.</p>', 'Though often referred to by its nickname, Cleopatra''s Needle, this ancient artifact was in fact commissioned by Pharaoh Thutmosis III around 1500 BC in celebration of his 3rd jubilee (or the 30th year of his reign).', 'obelisk, cleopatra''s needle, egyptian monument, monument, central park landmark', 95.10, 24, '<script type=''text/javascript''><!--//<![CDATA[\r\n   var m3_u = (location.protocol==''https:''?''https://ads.centralpark.com/www/delivery/ajs.php'':''http://ads.centralpark.com/www/delivery/ajs.php'');\r\n   var m3_r = Math.floor(Math.random()*99999999999);\r\n   if (!document.MAX_used) document.MAX_used = '','';\r\n   document.write ("<scr"+"ipt type=''text/javascript'' src=''"+m3_u);\r\n   document.write ("?zoneid=15&blockcampaign=1");\r\n   document.write (''&cb='' + m3_r);\r\n   if (document.MAX_used != '','') document.write ("&exclude=" + document.MAX_used);\r\n   document.write ("&loc=" + escape(window.location));\r\n   if (document.referrer) document.write ("&referer=" + escape(document.referrer));\r\n   if (document.context) document.write ("&context=" + escape(document.context));\r\n   if (document.mmm_fo) document.write ("&mmm_fo=1");\r\n   document.write ("''></scr"+"ipt>");\r\n//]]>--></script><noscript><a href=''http://ads.centralpark.com/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a026fe8a&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE'' target=''_blank''><img src=''http://ads.centralpark.com/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=15&n=a026fe8a'' border=''0'' alt='''' /></a></noscript>', '', '', '', 'lake800.jpg', '<a href="http://www.centralpark.com/pages/about-centralpark-com/staff/aric-boyles.html">Aric Boyles</a>', '', '', 0, '', '', 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 'Obelisk', 'Obelisk', 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

However, over time, the bridle path became frequently filled with other park users and it became too difficult to safely navigate on horse. In 2007, the stable was forced to close, and with it the only vendor of horse transportation in the park.</p>\r\n<p>From 2007 to 2011, horseback riding was available from Riverdale Equestrian Center on a very limited basis. Private trail rides could only occur in the park by appointment. In response to public requests that horseback riding in Central Park be reinstated, the Parks Department began negotiations in 2011 with the Riverdale Equestrian Center to make horseback riding once again available to any visitor who was in the park during operating hours.</p>\r\n{{ADSPACE_300_250}}\r\n<p>For the 2011 spring season, horseback riding was provided by the Riverdale Equestrian Center at 100 dollars per hour, up from 50 dollars in 2007.

It is recommended, for safety reasons, that you run against the traffic.</p>\r\n<p>There are a variety of loops and locations that are ideal for running in the park.&nbsp; Below are some of the most popular:</p>\r\n<p>A full loop through Central Park is nearly 6.1 miles and runs along the Park Drives on the West and East sides using the various transverses to cut across the park.&nbsp; Shorter variations are also possible.&nbsp; For example, you could take two 5-mile loops through the lower and upper sections of the park or a 1.7 mile loop in the southern part of the park by the Tavern on the Green.</p>\r\n{{ADSPACE_300_250}}\r\n<table border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="0" align="right" bgcolor="#ffffff">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="center"><img style="border: 0pt none;" title="Fit Tours NYC running central park" src="http://www.centralpark.com/updata/Image/FitToursNYC.JPG" alt="Fit Tours NYC running central park" width="200" height="200" /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="left"><strong><a title="fit tours nyc running central park" href="http://www.centralpark.com/guide/classes/fit-tours-nyc.html">Fit Tours NYC Running Class</a></strong></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>The Reservoir loop gives runners a soft surface cinder pathway of just over 1.5 miles around the <a title="jacqueline kennedy onassis reservoir" href="http://www.centralpark.com/guide/attractions/reservoir.html">Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir</a>.&nbsp; It has a slight 2&ordm; slope and offers spectacular city views.&nbsp; Stay to the right on this path and run counterclockwise.</p>\r\n<p>There are also two Bridle Path Loops to choose from, both on dirt.&nbsp; The shorter of the two is 1.66 miles and circles around the Reservoir below the aforementioned cinder path.&nbsp; The Full Bridle Path Loop is 2.5 miles and extends beyond the Reservoir, further north to the <a title="north meadow" href="http://www.centralpark.com/guide/attractions/north-meadow.html">North Meadow</a> fields and across the 102nd Street Transverse.&nbsp; It eventually rejoins the main path after some time on the West Drive.&nbsp; Please note that horses have the right of way on the Bridle Paths, so make sure that you are aware of their location.</p>\r\n<p>Download a free&nbsp;<a href="http://www.centralpark.com/usr/maps/CentralParkRunningMap.pdf">running map</a>&nbsp;here.</p>\r\n<p>Also, if you want some company on your run, check out our <a title="Fit Tours NYC" href="http://www.centralpark.com/guide/classes/fit-tours-nyc.html">Fit Tours NYC classes</a>, our <a href="http://www.walkjogrun.net/groups/centralpark" target="_blank">Central Park Running Group</a> at <a href="http://www.walkjogrun.net/" target="_blank">WalkJogRun.net</a>.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.nyrr.org" target="_blank">New York Road Runners</a> hosts more than 100 running events every year in Central Park, and also has a kiosk in the park at the East 90th Street Entrance and East Drive by theEngineers'' Gate.&nbsp; Open from 6:30AM- 7:00PM Monday through Friday, 10:00AM- 5:00PM on Saturday and 10:00AM - 3:00PM on Sunday, runners can go here for assistance and information about events.</p>', 'With the variety of terrain combined with the gorgeous scenery of the surrounding landscape, Central Park is a runner''s paradise.', 'Central Park, NYC, New York City, jogging, races, running, nyrrc, running map, central park running map, buy central park running map', 0.00, 0, '<script type=''text/javascript''><!--//<![CDATA[\r\n   var m3_u = (location.protocol==''https:''?''https://ads.centralpark.com/www/delivery/ajs.php'':''http://ads.centralpark.com/www/delivery/ajs.php'');\r\n   var m3_r = Math.floor(Math.random()*99999999999);\r\n   if (!document.MAX_used) document.MAX_used = '','';\r\n   document.write ("<scr"+"ipt type=''text/javascript'' src=''"+m3_u);\r\n   document.write ("?zoneid=7&amp;blockcampaign=1");\r\n   document.write (''&amp;cb='' + m3_r);\r\n   if (document.MAX_used != '','') document.write ("&amp;exclude=" + document.MAX_used);\r\n   document.write ("&amp;loc=" + escape(window.location));\r\n   if (document.referrer) document.write ("&amp;referer=" + escape(document.referrer));\r\n   if (document.context) document.write ("&context=" + escape(document.context));\r\n   if (document.mmm_fo) document.write ("&amp;mmm_fo=1");\r\n   document.write ("''></scr"+"ipt>");\r\n//]]>--></script><noscript><a href=''http://ads.centralpark.com/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a98c2241&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE'' target=''_blank''><img src=''http://ads.centralpark.com/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=7&n=a98c2241'' border=''0'' alt='''' /></a></noscript>\r\n', '', '', '', 'softball.jpg', '<a href="http://www.centralpark.com/pages/about-centralpark-com/staff/rick-anderson.html">Rick Anderson</a>', '', '', 0, '', '', 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 'Running', 'Running', 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

The most popular place to skate in Central Park is the Loop, which is closed to car traffic at all times except morning and evening rush hour on weekdays. It is easy to choose between two versions of the Loop - one is shorter and one is longer. The longer loop is 5 miles long, and the shorter one is 2.5 miles long. When you skate past the <a title="Loeb Boathouse" href="http://www.centralpark.com/guide/attractions/loeb-boathouse.html">Loeb Boathouse</a>, you will have the option to go right up Cat Hill, or bear left to stay on the smaller loop.</p>\r\n<p>Traffic on the Loop is one-way; you should travel it counterclockwise. If you''re not sure which way is correct, look for the large white arrows painted on the pavement. Never go clockwise, or the wrong way, on the Loop. This could cause an accident. If you absolutely must backtrack, go very slowly along the side or even on the grass if you can.</p>\r\n<p>It is very important to follow safety rules on the Loop and be mindful of other users on the trail, since the Loop is not just for inline skaters. During times when cars are allowed on the Loop, all other trail users must stay in the far right lane. Naturally, this means that the lane gets crowded during these times, so if you are a neophyte skater, consider skating at a different time. When the Loop is closed to cars, the far right lane is reserved for the user of joggers.

To aid you in your quest to identify the various species of plant life located within the space, bronze plaques with corresponding quotations from Shakespeare''s plays have been placed sporadically along the path.

Upon its creation, the Meadow''s purpose was to serve as a parade ground for military drills, as this was one of the rules of the design contest. Though this idea contrasted with contest winners Olmsted and Vaux''s vision of the Park as a peaceful and nature-based environment, they were initially obligated to comply with this rule. Among the Park''s original constructions, Sheep Meadow was by far the most costly, and the designers had to order a reshaping of the land and the uprooting of immigrants to create it.</p>\r\n{{ADSPACE_300_250}}\r\n<p>This idea of the Meadow as a parade ground was quickly abandoned however, and, in 1864, 200 sheep were placed in the Park and housed in a Victorian building within the Meadow. In 1934 these sheep were transported to Prospect Park, Brooklyn and were replaced with Tavern on the Green. The 60''s and 70''s saw Sheep Meadow used for war protests, outdoor concerts, and hippie "love-ins", and the 1969 moon landing was also televised at the Meadow.</p>\r\n<p>Sheep Meadow hosts an annual 4th of July fireworks celebration, in addition to the many other events and concerts that take place here each year.</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0 0 20px; text-align: right;"><small>&mdash; Jesse M.

By 1927, there were 30 courts (the present number) and then there were demands for a fieldhouse with lockers and showers. In 1930, the Tennis House was completed and more than 5,000 season permits for the courts, costing $2, were issued.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">In the 1970&rsquo;s the Central Park Conservancy and NYC Parks Department started to reexamine the park, the function, the layout along with the few permanent structures and buildings that exist in the park. &nbsp;The Tennis House was never part of the original design of the park. The city''s Landmarks Preservation Commission gave permission to demolish the existing Tennis House in April 1986 and there were no protests at that time.&nbsp;Then a group of people gathered to object the plans and said that the plans for the new Tennis House would be too small and situated too far away from the courts. &nbsp;Due to the financial crisis of that time, the Tennis House was left standing and the plans for a new one were forgotten. Instead money was raised and donated to renovate the existing structure. The structure that you see standing today looks very much as it did 80 years ago.</p>\r\n<p><span style="background: #efefef; color: green; padding: 2px;"><span style="background: #efefef; color: green; padding: 2px;"><span style="background: #efefef; color: green; padding: 2px;">{{ADSPACE_300_250}}</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p>Whether you''re a beginner or an experienced &nbsp;player looking to improve your game, the Tennis Center is a great place to practice your skills.

It began with New Yorkers dropping off unwanted animals at the arsenal. These included everything from 72 white swans to a black bear cub (everything, that is, except the apocryphal alligators that found their way to the sewer system.) In 1864 the legislature approved the construction of a several buildings to house the growing collection and the Central Park Menagerie was born. In 1934 Parks Commissioner Robert Moses used Works Progress Administration (WPA) funds to construct what was, for its time, a state-of-the-art facility. Designed with a storybook theme the new Central Park Zoo provided a greatly improved home for the animals and a wonderful place to visit them.</p>\r\n<p>As time passed, however, it became apparent that the zoo was becoming woefully inadequate for the residents. In the spring of 1980 the Wildlife Conservation Society entered into an agreement with the City of New York to renovate and operate the zoo on behalf of the Parks Department. Construction was finished by 1985 and the new Central Park Zoo was a reality, and the park once again was home to a facility which is considered one of the finest of its kind. The zoo in Central Park now attracts nearly a million visitors a year from all over the world.</p>\r\n<p>The new zoo is divided into several different sections which provide the animals with homes as close to their natural habitat as possible. These include tropic, temperate and polar zones that house everything from tiny leafcutter ants to the hugely popular polar bears. The zoo is also actively involved the preservation of endangered species, providing a home for rare tamarin monkeys, Wyoming toads, thick-billed parrots, and red pandas.</p>\r\n<p><span style="background: #efefef; color: green; padding: 2px;">{{ADSPACE_300_250}}</span></p>\r\n<p>The zoo has always held a special spot in the hearts of New Yorkers who have come to adopt the animals as prized members of the metropolitan community. The early menagerie was home to "Murphy" the hippo and "Mike Crowley," the first chimpanzee ever shown in the United States. In fact, when Mr. Crowley took ill, get well cards poured in from fans all over the city. The current &ldquo;personalities&rdquo; that have become crowd favorites include polar bears Gus and Ida and a pair of red pandas: Goodwin, and his new mate.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Other popular pages</strong></p>\r\n<p><a title="Central Park New York City" href="http://www.centralpark.com">Central Park New York City</a>&nbsp;[Homepage]&nbsp;</p>', 'Just a few yards from 5th Ave. you will find over 130 species at the Central Park Zoo - from Snow Leopards to tiny Leaf Cutter Ants.

While some of the more organized music shows only take place during the summer, many of the street performers will continue throughout the winter months, so you can feel free to visit Central Park any time of the year to hear sounds that will delight your ears.</p>', 'Summer in Central Park brings lots of music and many free concerts.

At the same time you are able to focus that much better on the person strolling at your side. Tree branches interlace the sky and you follow walkways that stretch ahead in soothing curves; you&rsquo;ve left behind the hard angles of avenues and the harsh reality of cement. Here your perception is filtered through a lens of diffuse clarity; your senses heightened, reflexes relaxed. The park becomes the perfect place for heartfelt declarations and, perhaps, subtle seduction.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Picnic in the Park</strong> &ndash; Pack a picnic lunch or light dinner, or have one prepared at one of the many specialty food shops that ring the park. Add a bottle of sparkling cider and toast the sunset from any one of the many lovely spots the park provides for blanket spreading. A favorite spot is Cherry Hill, just west of <a href="page.php?pid=37">Bethesda Fountain</a>. <a href="http://www.centralpark.com/store/central-park-picnic-backpack-p-50.html"><img style="width: 84px; height: 104px;" src="http://www.centralpark.com/updata/Central_Park_Backpack_for_Two_thumb.jpg" border="0" alt="" hspace="6" vspace="6" width="84" height="104" align="left" /></a>There you can relax on a gentle slope overlooking the lake and watch the rowboats glide along the glassy surface. Or just wander around and find your own favorite spot.

Take a seat under one of the flowering trees, for an added touch try reciting a poem, from memory if possible. Yes it&rsquo;s a bit corny, but it works. As long as you don&rsquo;t choose Dr. Seuss.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Walks</strong> &ndash; Take a walk through the <a href="page.php?pid=77">Shakespeare Garden</a> and then check out the view from <a href="page.php?pid=36">Belvedere Castle</a>. Stroll along the Mall up to <a href="page.php?pid=37">Bethesda Terrace</a>. <a href="page.php?pid=80">Strawberry Fields</a>, the <a href="page.php?pid=55">North Meadow</a> - the park offers endless possibilities for simply walking hand in hand and exploring the landscape.</p>\r\n<p><a href="page.php?pid=29"><strong>Rowboats</strong></a> &ndash; Try something classic - rent a rowboat at the Boathouse and row around the lake. Take a tour of the western end of the lake, north along the ramble or south around Wagner cove. Or just float about and marvel at the skyline as the sunsets over the West Side of Manhattan.</p>\r\n<p><a href="page.php?pid=71"><strong>Ice Skating</strong></a> - Ice skating in Central Park is easily one of the most picturesque and romantic, activities to be enjoyed on a winter&rsquo;s night. Feel the cold tingle of New York''s crisp winter air, listen to the music, and take in the incomparable surroundings as you glide (gracefully or not so) around the rink. Then share a hot chocolate and critique the other skaters from the terrace overlooking the rink.</p>\r\n<p><a href="page.php?pid=90"><strong>Concerts in the Park</strong></a> - Virtually every musical genre imaginable is featured at sometime and someplace during the summer months in Central Park. These include free performances by the New York Philharmonic and the Metropolitan Opera on the Great Lawn, Summerstage at Rumsey Playfield and the concert series at Naumburg Bandshell. What could be more romantic than relaxing on a blanket on the <a href="page.php?pid=45">Great Lawn</a>, listening to the New York Philharmonic and staring up into the sky.</p>\r\n<p><a href="page.php?pid=95"><strong>Dinner in the Park</strong></a>&ndash; Take a walk through the park and finish with a surprise dinner at the <a href="page.php?pid=108">Boathouse Restaurant</a>, but make sure to call ahead to check on reservations.</p>\r\n<p>Also see: <a href="page.php?pid=52">Dating Ideas</a></p>\r\n<p>And please use the comments buton at the top to share your favorite Romantic moments in Central Park</p>', 'Central Park, by its very nature, is one of the most romantic spots in New York City.

With densest fur of any land mammal Stripe has the distinction of owning the warmest fur coat in Manhattan. His fur protects him so much that he would only begin to shiver at -50 degrees F! When sleeping, this fox will use its bushy tail like a scarf, wrapping around its face and leg to protect it from the cold and wind. Stripe even has furred paws for warmth while walking on snow and to prevent it from slipping, just like his friend the Polar bear. Artic Foxes have evolved shorter, rounded ears, muzzles, and legs to hold in heat better. Much like your average busboy.</p>\r\n<p>An Arctic fox&rsquo;s fur changes color depending on the seasons &ndash; white in winter &ndash; tundra gray in summer. This is helpful when hunting food, such as lemmings or squirrels, or avoiding becoming food. If you have a cat and a sweater, you know all too well aware of the process of shedding hair to prepare for warm weather.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Diet </strong></p>\r\n<p>The Arctic fox uses its great sense of smell and of hearing to detect prey beneath the snow and ice. They are also known to track Polar bears, shadowing them and feasting on the remains of their food. You may guess that the bears do not appreciate this so the fox&rsquo;s white coat and amazing speed (up to 25mph) are useful for staying out of a bears&rsquo; way. At the CPZ, Stripe is fed a gourmet confection of horsemeat, dog kibble, and bird salad.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Conservation </strong></p>\r\n<p>Global warming is having a significant impact on the habitat of the Arctic fox. Food availability is reduced. The Arctic foxes are also being pushed north by their southern cousins, the Red fox. These larger canines cannot live in the icy environments of the tundra. The official status of the Arctic fox is &ldquo;non-threatened&rdquo;. But while the world population is abundant, this animal is on the point of extinction in the southern parts of its range, like Sweden and Finland. Only Alaska and Canada possess large tundra regions too severe for the Red fox to live. Unfortunately, these populations are now under threat because of oil drilling in the Arctic Refuge.</p>', 'The Central Park Zoo is home to an Artic Fox (Alopex lagopus), named Stripe.

This is due to their long front flippers, strong enough that they can balance their weight on them. Considering a male sea lion may reach up to 1000 lbs., this is no small feat. Female sea lions may weigh between 100-400 lbs. and reach approximately 5-6.5 feet in length. The CPZ&rsquo;s 2 female sea lions average between 200-400 lbs. &nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Zoo Sea Lion Habitat:</strong> The large tank is lightly chlorinated and contains 148,000 gallons of water.

At the CPZ, the two sea lions are fed capelin, herring, vitamin E, and salt supplements. Feedings coincide with behavior enrichment and training three times a day at 11:30 AM, 2 PM and 4 PM. <br /><br /><strong>Life span:</strong> A California sea lion&rsquo;s average life span is 17 years but can live much longer in captivity.</p>\r\n<table border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="0" align="right" bgcolor="#ffffff">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="center">\r\n<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" bgcolor="#ffffff">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="center"><img style="border: 0pt none;" title="April and Scooter in the Snow" src="http://www.centralpark.com/updata/Image/twosealions.jpg" alt="Two Sea Lions in the Snow" width="168" height="197" /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="right"><a href="http://www.judithwolfe.com" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><em>Judith Wolfe</em> </span></a></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="center">\r\n<p align="left"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><strong>Scooter &amp; April in a winter snow</strong> </span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Threats: </strong>Pollution, over fishing, oil drilling and spilling, and coastal development.<br /><br /><strong>Fun Facts:</strong> California sea lions are able to hold their breath for up to 15 minutes and dive to depths of 700 feet.

Water depth is 6 feet and the tank is filtered at 400 gallons per minute. Nixon has access to land and is hand fed during his behavioral enrichment sessions on solid ground. However, seals are not able to move very well on land. Unlike sea lions, such as the CPZ&rsquo;s California sea lions, &ldquo;true seals&rdquo; have short flippers on which they are unable to balance their weight. This makes it harder to get around on land and often you&rsquo;ll see Nixon rolling into the water after his feedings.</p>\r\n{{ADSPACE_300_250}}\r\n<p><strong>What do they eat:</strong>&nbsp; Harbor seals eat fish and invertebrates such as crabs, squid, and shrimp. At the CPZ, Nixon eats capelin, herring, Vitamin E, and salt supplements.<br /><br /><strong>Life span:</strong>&nbsp; Harbor seals may live 25 to 32 years.</p>\r\n<table border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="0" align="right" bgcolor="#ffffff">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="center">\r\n<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" bgcolor="#ffffff">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="center"><img style="border: 0pt none;" src="http://www.centralpark.com/updata/Image/harbrseal.jpg" alt="ALT TEXT GOES HERE" width="166" height="165" /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="right"><a href="http://www.judithwolfe.com" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><em>Judith Wolfe</em> </span></a></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="center">\r\n<p align="left"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Harbor Seal looking at you!</strong> </span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Threats:&nbsp;</strong> In the 1960&rsquo;s many Harbor seals were killed because they were thought to be preying on salmon.

Penguin predators include killer whales (Orcinus orca) and leopard seals (Hydrurga leptonyx). Both species of predator can jump out of the water onto the edge of the ice to attack, so penguins have adapted and are able jump 6 feet out of the water. On land penguin chicks are in danger from gulls, skuas, and other sea birds. Global warming is affecting Antarctica twice as fast as it is here in NYC. Nesting sites are becoming slushy because of the warming trend and nests are unusable. While the number of penguins is approximately 15 million, the change in climate has serious implications on the penguins&rsquo; diet in addition to loss of nesting sites. Some of you may recently have heard of the giant iceberg that blocked penguins from their feeding grounds. This is a direct result of global warming.<br /><br /><strong>Fun Facts:</strong> Penguins are social creatures. They live in large colonies called rookeries. They waddle when they walk. Penguins communicate with each other through body language. They spend most of their lives in water. Their body is insulated with a thick layer of blubber that keeps them warm. They are counter-shaded for camouflage. Baby penguins have soft feathers known as down. They count on their parents for food until they grow up with waterproof juvenile feathers. They pick up stones and store them in their crop. This helps them to float when they are in water.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align="center">\r\n<object width="340" height="285" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/NVkeSnsM0A0&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash">\r\n<param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" />\r\n<param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" />\r\n<param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/NVkeSnsM0A0&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" />\r\n<param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" />\r\n</object>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'The Central Park Zoo Edge of the Icepack building is home to 65 penguins, divided between two species: Gentoo and Chinstrap.', 'Central Park, NYC, New York City,  weekend, weekend activities, weekend family programs, Penguins, Central Park Zoo', 148.70, 36, '<script type=''text/javascript''><!--//<![CDATA[\r\n   var m3_u = (location.protocol==''https:''?''https://ads.centralpark.com/www/delivery/ajs.php'':''http://ads.centralpark.com/www/delivery/ajs.php'');\r\n   var m3_r = Math.floor(Math.random()*99999999999);\r\n   if (!document.MAX_used) document.MAX_used = '','';\r\n   document.write ("<scr"+"ipt type=''text/javascript'' src=''"+m3_u);\r\n   document.write ("?zoneid=20&amp;blockcampaign=1");\r\n   document.write (''&amp;cb='' + m3_r);\r\n   if (document.MAX_used != '','') document.write ("&amp;exclude=" + document.MAX_used);\r\n   document.write ("&amp;loc=" + escape(window.location));\r\n   if (document.referrer) document.write ("&amp;referer=" + escape(document.referrer));\r\n   if (document.context) document.write ("&context=" + escape(document.context));\r\n   if (document.mmm_fo) document.write ("&amp;mmm_fo=1");\r\n   document.write ("''></scr"+"ipt>");\r\n//]]>--></script><noscript><a href=''http://ads.centralpark.com/www/delivery/ck.php?n=af4bb96a&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE'' target=''_blank''><img src=''http://ads.centralpark.com/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=20&n=af4bb96a'' border=''0'' alt='''' /></a></noscript>', '', '', '', 'sea_lion.jpg', '<a href="http://www.maryschwalm.com" target="_new">Mary Schwalm</a>', '', '', 0, '', '', 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 'Penguins', 'Penguins', 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

He was euthanized (2013) at age 27 due to an inoperable thyroid tumor. Ida, the female bear, was euthanized (2011) at age 25 due to liver cancer. They are both greatly missed.<br /><br /><strong>Found in the wild:</strong> Along the coasts and inland streams and lakes of Alaska and Canada, Greenland, Norway and Siberia. The Greek word Arktos, meaning &ldquo;bear&rdquo;, is the origin of the Arctic name. Antarctica means &ldquo;no bears&rdquo;, so do not believe those commercials that feature a polar bear and a penguin together. It just isn&rsquo;t true, they live on opposite ends of the earth.<br /><br /><strong>See Them at the Central Park Zoo:</strong>&nbsp;Gus and Ida the polar bears have both passed away and are no longer living in the zoo. Meet Betty and Veronica, two female grizzly bear rescues.<br /><br /><strong>Description:</strong> The males weigh 660 to 1,760 pounds and females&mdash;330 to 700 pounds. Our male, Gus, weighs about 1000 pounds and Ida, the female, weighs in at 650. A polar bear&rsquo;s body temperature is 98.6 degrees F, just like us. They have a dense, thick undercoat of fur and are protected by an outer coat of long guard hairs that stick together when wet, forming a waterproof barrier to keep them dry. Even though polar bears look white, their hair is really made of clear, hollow tubes filled with air. Polar bears have black skin. A layer of 2 to 4 inches of blubber helps insulate polar bears from the freezing air and cold water, and acts as a nutritional reserve when food can&rsquo;t be found. This blubber also helps the bears float in the water.</p>\r\n{{ADSPACE_300_250}}\r\n<p><strong>Zoo Bear Habitat:</strong> The Polar bear exhibit is a rocky expanse containing a waterfall, some ice, and 90,000 gallons of freshwater. The water is 10 feet deep and the temperature isn&rsquo;t regulated, but adjusts with the seasons between 45-75 degrees F. Each bear has a den with air conditioning to help get through the hottest days. <br /><br /><strong>What do they eat:</strong>&nbsp; They like to eat meat and seals are their favorite food. They will eat most anything including walrus, caribou, grass, berries and seaweed. They are very patient hunters and will wait hours for a seal to pop up through a hole in the ice.&nbsp; At the Central Park Zoo, Gus and Ida are fed their main meal at the end of the day after the visitors have left. Their meals include mackerel, chicken, beef, horsemeat, and what the keepers refer to as &ldquo;bear chow&rdquo;. Every day the keepers encourage Gus and Ida to hunt for their food by hiding fish in frozen blocks, inside toys or in the rock crevices of their habitat. This stimulation keeps Gus and Ida active and healthy.</p>\r\n<table border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="0" align="right" bgcolor="#ffffff">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="center">\r\n<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" bgcolor="#ffffff">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="center"><img style="border: 0pt none;" title="Gus and his blue ball toy" src="http://www.centralpark.com/updata/Image/blueball.jpg" alt="Gus plays in the water" width="224" height="175" /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="right"><a href="http://www.judithwolfe.com" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><em>judithwolfe.com</em> </span></a></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="center">\r\n<p align="left"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><strong>Gus swims with his blue ball toy</strong> </span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Life span:</strong> 25 to 30 years in the wild and up to 45 years in zoos<br /><br /><strong>Threats:</strong> Global warming is their main threat. Currently there are approximately 25,000 Polar bears in the Arctic, but this number is dwindling. Global warming is affecting the poles twice as fast as it is here in New York. This means that ice is melting earlier and Polar bears are not getting enough food. This is especially important for female Polar bears. Pregnant females may gain up to 440 extra lbs. to prepare themselves for the den, where they will spend many consecutive months without eating. The female will live off her fat stores. If she does not have enough fat to live on when her cubs are born (avg. litter of two), her milk will not produce enough to feed the cubs and herself- she must abandon them to save her own life. <br /><br /><strong>Fun Facts:</strong> A newborn weighs only 1 to 2 pounds and are blind and helpless.&nbsp; The polar bear''s nose is so powerful it can smell a seal on the ice 20 miles away.

In fact, Tufted puffins are only &ldquo;tufted&rdquo; during the breeding season and molt their eyebrow-like tufts during the late summer/fall. The rest of the year is spent floating along the Northern Pacific, from the Japanese islands north along the Russian coast, across to Alaska, and south even as far as Santa Barbara, California.<br /><br /><strong>See Them at the Central Park Zoo:</strong> They can be found at the edge of the ice pack building in the same room as the penguins.

The water temperature is 42 degrees F and has a depth of 8 feet. The exhibit holds 6,000 gallons of water and is filtered at 150 gallons per minute. Lighting is an important factor for puffins as it stimulates breeding and molting seasons. Because NYC is in the Northern Hemisphere, we are on the same light cycle as the puffins. For example, during summer the days are longer and the sun is brighter. However, during winter, the days are shorter and the sunlight is weaker. You will see examples of this if you visit the Edge of the Icepack building, where both CPZ penguins and puffins are on the Northern Hemisphere&rsquo;s light cycle.</p>\r\n{{ADSPACE_300_250}}\r\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> These members of the Auk family are able to fly, unlike their southern counterpart the penguin. Their short, rounded wings aid in flight but must be beaten furiously to stay airborne. The wings also act as flippers underwater. They generally weigh up to 28 ounces and are approximately 11 inches tall. Their yellow beaks are much shorter and thicker than penguins, and stand out vibrantly against the black of their feathers.<br /><br /><strong>&nbsp;What do they eat: </strong>In the wild Tufted puffins eat capelin, sand eel, anchovy, Pacific herring, squid, sea urchins, and algae. At the CPZ, puffins are fed capelin, Vitamin E, and salt supplements.<br /><br /><strong>Life span:</strong>&nbsp; Tufted puffins will live approximately 25 years.<br /><br /><strong>Threats:</strong> Current threats to Tufted puffins are oil spills, over fishing, and the introduction of the Arctic fox to the Aleutian Islands in Alaska. <br /><br /><strong>Fun Facts:</strong> Puffins may dive deeper than 24 m (80 ft.) to catch fish. Their bills have specialized sharp hooks that help to hold fish. One puffin was seen holding 62 fish in its bill at one time. Puffins are powerful flyers, beating their wings 300-400 times a minute to achieve speeds up to 64 kph (40 mph). Puffins are members of the Alcidae Family (called alcids).

Pair bonds are very strong among them and if they survive beyond one breeding season, they will return to the same bond rather than establish new ones.

The area is surrounded by land and by trees, including Red twig dogwood and Arrow-wood viburnum.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Habitat</strong> : North America from Florida to Alaska. North American river otters are not necessarily confined to rivers, as their name implies. They may be found near rivers, streams, swamps, marshes, bays, ponds, lakes, and even near sea coasts.

They are able to close their nostrils and ears under water, and may dive to depths up to 35 feet. Using their clawed, webbed feet and long tails to propel and steer themselves, they may reach speeds up to 7 miles per hour. Amazingly, by alternating steps and belly slides a North American river otter can move along on land up to 15-18 mph. Sight and touch are important and their whiskers are sensitive to water turbulence, which helps them locate movement in the water. Their water-repellent fur helps them stay warm along with the dense under fur so they can stay warm in and out of the water, even at the northernmost part of their territory- Alaska.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Life span</strong> : In the wild river otters may live up to 16 years.

Red pandas are hard to breed. A female Red panda may only go through estrus once a year and be receptive for an 18-24 hour period.

Red pandas live in temperate forests at elevations of 4,900 to 13,000 feet.<br /><br /><strong>See Them at the Central Park Zoo:</strong> The Temperate Zone is home to our Red Pandas, also known in Chinese as &ldquo;hun-ho&rdquo; or &ldquo;fire-fox&rdquo;.</p>\r\n{{ADSPACE_300_250}}\r\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> The Lesser panda, or Red panda, is a bright reddish brown color. It has a white, masked face and a long, ringed tail resembling that of a raccoon. Red pandas may weigh up to 13 lbs and may reach a length of 25 inches. This mild-mannered animal will defend its territory by standing on its hind legs and using those sharp claws to strike out if threatened. If that doesn''t work at keeping enemies away, the panda can release a strong odor from scent glands at the base of the tail. Red pandas can also make a variety of calls, including shrill cries, whistles, and a birdlike chirp.</p>\r\n<table border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="0" align="right" bgcolor="#ffffff">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="center">\r\n<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" bgcolor="#ffffff">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="center"><img style="border: 0pt none;" title="Goodwin and Jen, CPZ Pandas" src="http://www.centralpark.com/updata/Image/twopandas.jpg" alt="Goodwin and Jen, Red Pandas" width="230" height="190" /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="right"><a href="http://www.judithwolfe.com" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><em>Judith Wolfe <br /></em></span></a></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="center"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Goodwin and Jen up in their tree</strong></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p><br /><strong>Zoo Panda Habitat:</strong>&nbsp; Look for our red pandas high up in the trees in their spacious, green home. They are excellent climbers and often sleep away the day. <br /><br /><strong>What do they eat:</strong> 99% of their diet is bamboo, but they may also on occasion eat roots, grasses, fruits, bird eggs, and small rodents.&nbsp; At the CPZ, the pandas are fed high fiber biscuits and bamboo.<br /><br /><strong>Life span:</strong>&nbsp; 8 to 10 years in the wild and many Zoo pandas can live beyond 15 years. <br /><br /><strong>Threats:</strong> Clouded leopards, Snow leopards, wild dogs, deforestation, and animal trade. <br /><br /><strong>Fun Facts:</strong> Bamboo is not a great food source for energy and is hard to digest. Red pandas need to eat 20 to 30 percent of their body weight each day &mdash; about 2 to 4 pounds of bamboo shoots and leaves.&nbsp; Many people are more familiar with giant pandas than red pandas, but the red pandas were introduced to Europeans in 1821 and described to Western science in 1825&mdash;more than 40 years before giant pandas were scientifically described in 1869. In the wild Red pandas are active at dawn and dusk and may search 13 hours for food and sleep the day away. Just like its raccoon relatives, the red panda dips its paws into water when it needs a drink.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'The Temperate Zone houses one Red panda (Ailurus fulgens), named Godwin.

Male frogs go through an elaborate ritual to attract a mate. The males vocalize, a loud trill sound, to attract females. Once the courtship ritual is complete, the females deposit dozens of eggs on leaves. During the two-week development period, the male returns to the eggs periodically to check on them. Once the tadpoles hatch, they swim onto the male&rsquo;s back and are attached by a mucus secretion, which keeps them from falling off. The male carries them to a place suitable for further development, such as wet holes in broken trees and branches and little ponds. Once at their final destination, the tadpoles are on their own.

Turtles tend to have webbed feet for swimming. <br /><br /><strong>Tortoise</strong>: A land-dweller that eats low-growing shrubs, grasses, and even cactus. Tortoises do not have webbed feet. Their feet are round and stumpy for walking on land. Tortoises that live in hot, dry habitats use their strong legs to dig burrows.

They are not echolocators, but use their eyesight for travel and to search for food.&nbsp; Males will vocalize, nip, or strike with their wings to defend breeding, roosting, and feeding territories from other male bats.<br /><br /><strong> </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>{{ADSPACE_300_250}}</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong> <span style="font-size: small;">Short-tailed fruit bat</span> </strong>(Carollia perspicillata) AKA Leaf-nosed fruit bat</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<table border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="0" align="right" bgcolor="#ffffff">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="center">\r\n<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" bgcolor="#ffffff">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="center"><img style="border: 0pt none;" title="Short-tailed Fruit Bats" src="http://www.centralpark.com/updata/Image/fruitbats.jpg" alt="Short-tailed Fruit Bats eating watermelon" width="168" height="175" /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="right"><a href="http://www.judithwolfe.com" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><em>Judith Wolfe&nbsp;</em> </span></a></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="center">\r\n<p align="left"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><strong>&nbsp; Short-tailed Fruit Bats eating</strong> </span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p><br /><strong>Zoo collection includes:</strong> Lots and lots of bats<br /><br /><strong>Found in the wild:</strong> Southern Mexico to Paraguay and southern Brazil, Trinidad, Tobago, and Grenada in the Lesser Antilles.<br /><br /><strong>See Them at the Central Park Zoo:</strong> This exhibit is located just after the Leafcutter ants in the Tropical Rain Forest.<br /><br /><strong>Description:</strong> Approximately 2 inches long with brown fur. Their ears are relatively simple, rigid, and usually erect. If you can get a good glimpse you might notice the leaf shape on the nose of the bats. This helps to focus and direct sounds when using echolocation.<br /><br /><strong>Zoo Bat Cave:</strong> The lighting has been adjusted so it is night in the exhibit and the bats are more active. This does, however, make them harder to see - but please do not use flash photography. Bats are not blind and the lights will hurt their eyes.<br /><br /><strong>What do they eat:</strong>&nbsp; At the CPZ, the Leaf-nosed fruit bats are fed diced bananas, apples, canned primate and feline diet, and fortified bat mix twice daily.<br /><br /><strong>Life span:</strong> Averages 2.5 years, but can live up to 10 years<br /><br /><strong>Threats:</strong>&nbsp; Destruction of their habitat due to population growth and forest clearing are among the major threats to their population.<br /><br /><strong>Fun Facts:</strong> There are over 1,000 different species of bats, and they occur on every continent except Antarctica. Only the mammal order Rodentia numbers more species. These small mammals have high metabolism; food travels through a fruit bat''s digestive system in about 30 minutes. When food is scarce, these bats will enter torpor, a sluggish state, to conserve energy.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'The Rodrigues fruit bat and the Short-tailed fruit bat  can be found living at the Central Park Zoo.', 'Central Park, NYC, New York City,  weekend, weekend activities, weekend family programs, Bats, Central Park Zoo', 3.50, 1, '<script type=''text/javascript''><!--//<![CDATA[\r\n   var m3_u = (location.protocol==''https:''?''https://ads.centralpark.com/www/delivery/ajs.php'':''http://ads.centralpark.com/www/delivery/ajs.php'');\r\n   var m3_r = Math.floor(Math.random()*99999999999);\r\n   if (!document.MAX_used) document.MAX_used = '','';\r\n   document.write ("<scr"+"ipt type=''text/javascript'' src=''"+m3_u);\r\n   document.write ("?zoneid=20&amp;blockcampaign=1");\r\n   document.write (''&amp;cb='' + m3_r);\r\n   if (document.MAX_used != '','') document.write ("&amp;exclude=" + document.MAX_used);\r\n   document.write ("&amp;loc=" + escape(window.location));\r\n   if (document.referrer) document.write ("&amp;referer=" + escape(document.referrer));\r\n   if (document.context) document.write ("&context=" + escape(document.context));\r\n   if (document.mmm_fo) document.write ("&amp;mmm_fo=1");\r\n   document.write ("''></scr"+"ipt>");\r\n//]]>--></script><noscript><a href=''http://ads.centralpark.com/www/delivery/ck.php?n=af4bb96a&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE'' target=''_blank''><img src=''http://ads.centralpark.com/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=20&n=af4bb96a'' border=''0'' alt='''' /></a></noscript>', '', '', '', 'sea_lion.jpg', '<a href="http://www.maryschwalm.com" target="_new">Mary Schwalm</a>', '', '', 0, '', '', 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 'Bats', 'Bats', 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Presently off exhibit.<br /><br /><strong>Description:</strong> The keel-billed toucan averages about 25 inches in length. Its body is covered with black plumage with red and white coverts under and on top of its tail. The toucan has green skin around its eyes and lore (the area between the eyes and the bill). The bird has a yellow face and throat and stands on two blue legs. Broad, heavy wings and a short tail force the bird to have a very laborious flight, flapping its wings hard in upward and downward movements. The most obvious characteristic of the toucan is its beak. A large rainbow colored structure, the beak appears quite heavy and cumbersome, but is actually light because it is composed of the protein keratin. The beak is hollow with thin rods of bone to support it. It houses a feather like tongue which catches the animal''s food and flicks it down its throat. <br /><br /><strong>What do they eat:</strong> Fruits (primarily berries), some insects, bird eggs, and tree frogs<br /><br /><strong>Life span:</strong> Up to 20 years<br /><br /><strong>Threats:</strong> Threatened, but not endangered, due to the destruction of its home the rain forest<br /><br /><strong>Fun Facts:</strong> The Keel-billed toucans are a very social bird and can often be seen in flocks of six or more birds.

Look up.<br /><br /><strong>Description:</strong> The blue-crowned motmot has a large head with down curved, short, broad beak, which is serrated along the upper edge. Their tarsi (feet) are unique in that they are particularly short with a middle toe almost completely fused to the inner toe and only one rear toe. Most of the species of motmots have tail feathers that distinguish them from other birds. The center tail feathers, which twitch like the pendulum of a clock when the motmot is perched, have bare spines at the tip. This makes them easily recognizable. The plumage of the blue-crowned motmot is shades of green and blue. They have red eyes, a turquoise crown and black face. It is about 17 inches long.<br /><br /><strong>What do they eat:</strong> Motmots feed primarily on insects, crushing them in their saw-edged bill. They round out this diet with fruit and occasionally larger prey animals like lizards, frogs, and even mice.<br /><br /><strong>Threats:</strong> Because they can live in many different forest types, ranging from rainforests to shaded coffee farms, the blue-crowned motmot is not on the endangered list. However, as shaded coffee farms and forests are destroyed, the survival of this beautiful bird is threatened.<br /><br /><strong>Fun Facts:</strong> The word "motmot" is an American-Spanish word coined as an imitation of the call that the birds make. The birds live by themselves or in pairs, never in flocks. Each pair keeps to a particular feeding territory. Like their cousins the kingfishers and bee eaters, motmots dig elaborate nests below the ground, consisting of a large tunnel extending six feet into an earthen bank.

Later, the chicks are left alone for several hours each day while both parents hunt for food. As a sunbittern spreads its wings, a patch of chestnut and orange appears on the primary wing feathers and across the tail. This display is primarily used as a threat or defense rather than courtship and is typically accompanied by a low hiss and bowing. These birds catch their prey by striking quickly, using their long neck and spear-like bill.

Hornbills have a remarkable breeding system. The female of almost all species is sealed into the nesting chamber in the tree during the breeding season. She remains there, laying and brooding her eggs and hatched young, with only a narrow slit-like opening to the outside. The female builds a wall across the entrance to the nesting cavity using her excrement, which cures to a very hard consistency. Sometimes the male bird assists with the building of this wall, using moist clay. Presumably, the walled-in female and nestlings are kept relatively safe from nest predators. However, both she and the developing nestlings must be fed faithfully by the male. In some species, the female breaks out of the nesting cavity once the chicks are partially grown. The cavity is then re-walled, and the female assists the male in gathering food for the hungry young hornbills.</p>\r\n<hr size="2" />\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><br /><br /><strong><br /></strong></p>\r\n<hr size="2" />\r\n<p class="MsoNormal"><br /><strong><br /></strong></p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: "><br style="page-break-before: always;" /> </span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'Central Park Zoo is home to African pygmy goose, Bali mynahs, Fairy bluebirds, Emerald starlings, Golden-breasted starlings,  Scarlet ibis, Speckled mousebirds Sunbitterns, Taveta golden weavers and much more.', 'Central Park, NYC, New York City, birds, doves, parrots, tanagers, Central Park Zoo', 20.00, 4, '', '', '', '', 'sea_lion.jpg', '<a href="http://www.maryschwalm.com" target="_new">Mary Schwalm</a>', '', '', 0, '', '', 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 'Birds', 'Birds', 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00');

The head and flight feather colors are slate blue<br />to black. They have a &ldquo;mane&rdquo; of long, hair-like feathers around the neck. The long neck feathers, called<br />hackles, are black and purple iridescence. The very short tail is pure white. Females have shorter neck<br />hackles.<br /><br /><strong>What do they eat:</strong>&nbsp; Seeds, berries, and insects. These birds feed on the ground.

The clearance of small islands for plantations and the adjacent areas of lowland forest which it requires for foraging must have reduced numbers. Predation by rats, cats and other alien predators at nesting grounds can affect large numbers of birds due to the colonial nature of the species.<br /><br /><strong>Fun Facts:</strong> Like all pigeons and doves, these birds do not not sip when drinking, but instead they immerse their bill, sucking up water. Males have a small black knob at the base of the bill near the forehead. The bill is strong and hooked.

The lower mandible is black.<br /><br /><strong>What do they eat:</strong> Includes wild figs, wild and orchard fruit, flowers, nectar, berries and leaves<br /><br /><strong>Life span:</strong> 15 or 20 years<br /><br /><strong>Threats: </strong>The species suffers from poaching for the illegal wildlife trade and fetches a high price in the black market. It is perhaps the rarest of all species of Psittacula in mainland Asia.<br /><br /><strong>Fun Facts: </strong>The bills of Derbyan parakeets are designed to nest in tree cavities that woodpeckers have previously dug out. Their markings are great for camouflage among the trees. The green and black feathers are perfect in matching them with the sun shining through the trees.

(139, '2009-05-19', 5, 1, 15, 'Central Park in the Cinema', '', 'history/central-park-in-the-cinema', 'Central Park in the Cinema', '<p>The earliest cinematic portrayals of Central Park were almost always romantic in nature.<img src="http://www.centralpark.com/pages/history/gothic-tree.jpg" border="0" alt="Tree on the Bridle Path" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="220" height="152" align="right" /> Whether it was the backdrop for joyous singing and dancing, as in <strong>&ldquo;On the Town&rdquo;</strong>, or the setting for sentimental love stories, such as <strong>&ldquo;Portrait of Jennie&rdquo;</strong>, the park was seen as either a place of populist energy or quiet romance. It is interesting to note that before the war, and for the first few years after, there are no movies that use Central Park as anything but a positive locale, one that resonates with the energy and romance of Manhattan. It''s not really until the early seventies that movies, usually comedies, dramatize the darker aspects of the park. It seems that in the middle sixties the park developed several different personalities, especially in the eyes of movie makers. Since then the Park has been generally characterized in movies in one of three ways. First it is seen as a romantic place, almost magical, a metaphor for all the beautiful, creative, fantastic things the city represents to so many people who love it. Secondly it is portrayed as a dark, dangerous and foreboding place, a symbol of urban decay and the decline of civilized society in the second half of the century. Lastly it is used simply as a park, a useful field of recreation and contemplation, simply the lungs of the city.</p>\r\n<p>One example of Central Park in its romantic role would be <strong>&ldquo;The World of Henry Orient&rdquo;</strong>, 1964, directed by George Roy Hill. In this movie the park is seen in autumn, a cheerful, pretty landscape that provides the back drop for the afternoon frolics of two young girls, played by Tippy Walker and Merrie Spaeth. It''s the scene of a day long fantasy, chasing over and under bridges, around lakes and statues that bonds the two together. It is also the trysting place of Peter Sellers and Paula Prentiss, which the girls discover to Seller&rsquo;s everlasting chagrin. Later in the movie, when Spaeth is searching for her missing friend, we see her wondering through a snow covered park, a bleak and barren landscape, all grey frost and frozen ground. But even in this wintry evocation the park is not seen as a threatening place. It is not yet dangerous and unforgiving of intruders.</p>\r\n<p>The most romantic view of the park is without doubt the found in the movie adaptation of the musical <strong>&ldquo;Hair&rdquo;</strong>, 1980, directed by Milos Forman. The film opens with an extended version of the song Aquarius that has Twyla Tharp choreographed dancers writhing about the lush autumn landscape along with police horses that prance in step to the music. It is a wild and joyful place filled with hippies and hope. It is their home, a place filled with promise and life, counter culture experimentation and an exuberant challenge to the concrete canyon dwellers that surround it. It is, of course, wildly simplistic and naive, but still it seduces you into thinking that even if it wasn''t exactly like that it should have been. For that matter it convinces you that that is the way it should still be. There are long shots that include the leafy vistas of the fall in New York and upwardly angled cameras that frame each character against the skyline. This is place you wanted to come to when you first heard about New York. It&rsquo;s a place where people dance and sing and experience life vividly and viscerally. The place you never quite found, the one you still dream about.</p>\r\n<p>In terms of pure fantasy the best example would be <strong>&ldquo;A Troll in Central Park&rdquo;</strong>, Don Bluth, 1994. It&rsquo;s an animated fairytale about a troll, named Stanley, that is banished to New York City for having a green thumb, the punishment being the assumption that there is no greenery to be found amidst Manhattan''s concrete canyons. Much to his delight, however, little Stanley finds himself dropped in Central Park, in mid spring. The park is drawn beautifully, with a remarkable respect given to geographic detail, and it becomes a final battle ground between powerful forces for good and evil. Of course the forces of good prevail and the park becomes an Eden-like garden in the process.</p>\r\n<p><center style="page-break-after: always;"></center></p>\r\n<p>On the negative side of the coin few movies can come close to <strong>&ldquo;The Out of Towners&rdquo;</strong>, 1970, directed by Arthur Hill and written by Neil Simon. In this film the park is portrayed as an extension of the inhospitable and menacing city landscape that surrounds it. Sandy Dennis and Jack Lemmon are forced to find refuge in the park after a series of increasingly farcical mishaps leaves them shelter less. While in the park they are mugged, attacked by a dog and then accused of child molesting. The picture we have of the park is a litter strewn no man''s land populated by criminals and unfriendly policemen. (It is in fact this unrelenting negativism that ultimately undermines the comedic credibility of the movie. By the end of the movie you''re rooting for dog that steals their crackerjacks.) The park itself is shot in a very unfriendly manner, with dark shadows at night and glaring sunlight during the day. There are no panoramic shots, no fountains or bridges, just old fences and scrawny bushes. It is clearly shown to be an unhealthy environment and a hazardous place at best. In fact it is not only an extension of the dangerous city that surrounds it has come to symbolize it. As far as Simon is concerned the park is the coup de gras of the many misfortunes that befall this hapless, humorless, frumpy couple.</p>\r\n<p>In <strong>&ldquo;The Still of the Night&rdquo;</strong>, directed by Robert Benton, Central Park is shot by night, in the vicinity of The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Roy Shieder is following Meryl Streep and thinks he sees her enter the park. He is in love with her, but of course suspects her of murder, a dating dilema in Manhattan that occurs with a great deal more frequency than you would like to think. He follows her figure into the park and is promptly mugged himself. The really nice twist to this scene is that after the mugger steals Roy''s raincoat he is in turn murdered after being mistaken for Mr. Shieder. (If only life in the big city was always this symmetrical.) In this case the park is seen as both romantic and dangerous, a place of intrigue and allure, although certainly still not one that you would like to visit after dark.</p>\r\n<p>The ultimate portrayal of Central Park as a dark and dangerous place is undoubtedly that of <strong>&ldquo;Where''s Papa?&rdquo;</strong>, directed by Carl Reiner. It was released in 1970, the same year as Neil Simon''s "Out of Towners", and carries the depiction of Central Park as a battle zone of urban violence to a hysterical degree, although probably not far from the truth in the eyes of most of the rest of America. George Segal lives with his senile mother on the Upper West Side. Ron Liebman lives with his family on the Upper East Side. George Segal calls his brother and to inform him that if he doesn''t come over and get Mom, thereby leaving George at home, alone, with his date, he is going to drop her out the window. Obviously Ron Liebman is in a great hurry to get there so he decides, rather illogically, to run directly across instead of taking a cab. This has apparently happened many times before and each time Mr. Liebman has been mugged. This time is no exception. Half way through the park Mr. Liebman''s character, Sidney, is accosted my four young men (One of whom is played by a young Garret Morris, pre SNL). They all recognize each other from his previous attacks. This time they decide to reenact a scene from the movie &ldquo;Naked Prey&rdquo;. This results in Sidney arriving at George''s without a stitch of clothing to much comedic effect. The point is, though, that once again Central Park is depicted as a completely unsafe, alien landscape that is dangerous to all "normal" people - once again a far cry from its original perception or intended use.</p>\r\n<p>A good example of the third characterization of the park, as simply a tree lined extension of the city around it is in <strong>&ldquo;Marathon Man&rdquo;</strong>, 1975, directed by John Schlesinger. In this film Dustin Hoffman plays a somewhat alienated graduate student that is training for the New York Marathon by running around the reservoir in Central Park. While the footage shot in the park is limited it is interesting for two reasons. The shots of Hoffman running show the park to be at the very least a functional landscape, a place that people can use for exercise and recreation. It is also notable for its last scene, which takes place in one of the century old pumping stations that are on either side of the reservoir. In it the evil Nazi Laurence Olivier is brought to justice, he is shot by Hoffman while being made to ingest the fortune in diamonds that he has murdered so ruthlessly to reclaim. Yet another killing in the park, but an interesting statement that it occurs only a few hundred yards from the townhouses of some of the most wealthy people in the world.</p>\r\n<p><center style="page-break-after: always;"></center></p>\r\n<p>In <strong>&ldquo;Eyewitness&rdquo;</strong>, 1981 directed by Peter Yates, the park is the scene of a picnic shared by Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt. It is set near a ball field, where Weaver, astride a fine brown horse, meets Hurt, on a Harley Davidson. The park is seen as a convivial kinetic landscape, a living space in which people play ball, eat picnic lunches, and live out their lives. (Sometimes going for days without dancing, singing or being brutally murdered.) The park here is a place where we could picture ourselves, hanging out with friends, relaxed and not feeling threatened. The camera is friendly to the landscape with long shots of playing fields and distant trees surrounded by buildings. We can sense that this place is indeed a refuge form city around it, a common ground in which Weaver can enjoy anonymity from her career as well known television reporter and Hurt can escape the drudgery of his life as a custodian. And, of course, a place where anyone can fall in love with anyone, the ultimate democratic ideal.</p>\r\n<p>Add to these two examples any of a half dozen Woody Allen movies that use the park as a backdrop for conversations between characters, including <strong>&ldquo;Annie Hall&rdquo;</strong>, <strong>&ldquo;Hannah and Her Sisters&rdquo;</strong> and <strong>&ldquo;Bullets Over Broadway&rdquo;</strong>. Mr. Allen exhibits a familiarity with park that most people have with their own front yards, which would make sense since Central Park is literally his.</p>\r\n<p>All of these movies share an interpretive legacy, in each one the park is used specifically as a metaphor for the city that surrounds it. This subtle allegory evolves over time from the happy singing and dancing of Gene Kelly to the beleagered wanderings of Jack Lemmon back to the joyous singing and dancing of Twyla Tharp, via Treat Williams et.al.. While it might be a stretch to discover a narrative flow over the course of these six decades it would be interesting to edit together a single movie of clips that use Central Park as a dramatic location. It would be enlightening to see how the portrayal of the park mirrored the popular conception of the city that surrounds it, how the way it was shot either enhanced its beauty or revealed a darker side.</p>\r\n<p>It would also be nice to see it get top billing.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'Central Park in the Cinema - A list of movies with scenes filmed in Central Park', 'Central Park, NYC, New York City, movies, film, cinema', 5.00, 1, '', '', '', '', 'sheep_meadow.jpg', '<a href="http://www.centralpark.com/pages/about-centralpark-com/staff/rick-anderson.html">Rick Anderson</a>', '', '', 0, '', '', 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 'Central Park in the Cinema', 'Central Park in the Cinema', 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00');

The Auxiliary Police Unit at the Central Park Unit is the perfect volunteer opportunity for those of you who enjoy walking in Central Park, meeting new people, and wishing to partake in a prestigious and well respected activity. Helping your fellow citizens and your Central Park Police Precinct only scratches the surface of the personal satisfaction you will gain from being a part of our unit and serving the Police Department of the City of New York.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are constantly soliciting applications to our unit and would like you to be a member of our team! Please continue reading below to learn more about the Auxiliary Police Program in Central Park and what the Auxiliary Police Unit at the Central Park Precinct is all about.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you like what you&rsquo;ve read, then we want to hear from you!<br /><br />Join us at the Central Park Precinct Auxiliary Police Unit!<br /><br />Yours sincerely,<br />A/Deputy Inspector Roger Thomas<br />Commanding Officer<br /><br />Auxiliary Police Unit<br />Central Park Precinct</p>\r\n<hr size="2" />\r\n<p><br /><br />WHAT IS AN AUXILIARY POLICE OFFICER?<br /><br />Auxiliary Police Officers are civic minded citizens who volunteer their time to The Police Department. They serve as the "eyes and ears" of the NYPD and report events that require police intervention.<br /><br />They provide additional police presence by conducting patrols in UNIFORM (provided WITHOUT COST by The Police Department). This activity helps fellow citizens and the police since it is well known that the mere presence of uniformed police officers is enough to deter would be criminals.<br /><br />Auxiliary Police Officers are equipped with the same Police Radios that regular police officers use when on patrol. Therefore you are directly linked to regular police officers at all times. (The Central Park Precinct Auxiliary Police Unit will train you how to communicate using the radios).<br /><br />WHAT IS EXPECTED OF AUXILIARY POLICE OFFICERS?<br /><br />First, you should be aware that the uniform that Auxiliary Police Officers wear virtually identical to the uniforms that regular NYPD Police Officers or AKA Sworn Members of the Service (M.O.S.) wear. They are expected to adhere to the same uniform requirements as regular police officers.<br /><br />Second, Auxiliary Police Officers are issued a shields (a silver seven point star) and NYPD photo credentials, which is carried at all times (off duty as well).<br /><br />Therefore, there is enormous responsibility, integrity, courtesy, professionalism and respect that we expect all of our Auxiliary Police Officers to adhere to at all times, on OR off duty. Those who cannot adhere to the above need not apply.<br /><br />WHAT IS THE TIME COMMITMENT?<br /><br />Auxiliary Police Officer Recruits must take a training course that meets once a week for 16 weeks. This is a course is like a mini-police academy that ends in a graduation ceremony at One Police Plaza. Topics include basic penal laws, police science, nightstick training, hand to hand combat, and hand-cuffing techniques. You must pass a multiple choice exam and a nightstick usage and hand-hand combat test.<br /><br />Thereafter, we expect Auxiliary Police Officers to commit to at least ONE night a week, OR one tour on the weekend.<br /><br />WHAT DO AUXILIARY POLICE OFFICERS DO IN CENTRAL PARK?<br /><br />Auxiliary Police Officers as part of the Central Park Precinct Auxiliary Police Unit are an integral part of the Central Park community.<br /><br />Auxiliary Police Officers conduct foot, bicycle, and car (RMP) patrol within the confines of the Central Park Precinct Command (aka Central Park).<br /><br />Auxiliary Police Officers also assist The Police during public events, such as the Metropolitan Opera, New York Philharmonic, Summerstage, and other concerts within the park.<br /><br />For more about the CENTRAL PARK PRECINCT click <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/precincts/precinct_022.shtml" target="_blank">here</a>.<br /><br />WHAT IS THE CENTRAL PARK AUXILIARY POLICE UNIT LIKE?<br /><br />1. The Auxiliary Police Unit in the Central Park Precinct is like a family. We are a group of dedicated fun loving GUYS and GIRLS (YES, GIRLS!!), and we have a great time both in and out of the precinct, though social gatherings, BBQ''s etc. ALL OF OUR MEMBERS HAVE EITHER FULL TIME JOBS OR ARE STUDENTS. We are both occupationally as well as ethnically diverse. (Our members include finance consultants, government office holders, computer programmers, SAG actors, media personnel, just to name a few).<br /><br />2. The members of the Auxiliary Police Unit in Central Park enjoy spending time with each other, and form strong bonds. Members always patrol in pairs; however it is common for patrol groups to be larger.<br /><br />3. The general philosophy of the unit is &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re not having a good time, then there&rsquo;s no point in volunteer&rdquo;. Therefore, we are a good humored and relaxed unit. However, we are serious when it is required. We expect the same from you. That is we expect you to be good humored (be able to take and give a joke or two) and to be serious when necessary.<br /><br /><center style="page-break-after: always;"></center>WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF BEING AN AUXILIARY POLICE OFFICER?<br /><br />1. Being apart of one of the most prestigious Auxiliary Police Units in the NYPD.<br />2. This opportunity provides excellent opportunity to learn how to communicate with the community. Since Auxiliary Police Officers patrol in uniform (and in pairs), they share in maintaining the integrity of The Police Department and help strengthen community bonds.<br />3. The satisfaction of helping the Central Park Community (Police Department, Park Conservancy, Park''s Enforcement, New York Road Runners, ASPCA, and the hundreds of people who use the park each day ). You may also attend Central Park Community meetings. In addition, this is A GREAT EXPOSURE to a law enforcement environment, for those of you who are thinking of police work as a career path (i.e. NYPD, Federal Law Enforcement, etc.). The unit has close bonds the regular cops in the precinct who are in turn grateful to have the help of Auxiliary Police Officers. Although it should be mentioned that MOST of DO NOT have interest in pursuing law enforcement careers, so IT IS an awesome opportunity for those who are NOT considering police work.<br />4. This looks great on your resume. For example under a "Community Service" heading, even if you don''t wish to be a cop. Our unit instills good leadership skills. It does stand out! (for those of you applying to Business School/Law School/Med school/ Career seekers, shifters and so on).<br />5. Opportunities for promotion to Sergeant, Lieutenant and more.<br />6. Allows you to develop preparedness and observation skills for emergency situations, especially in today&rsquo;s post 9/11 world. It should be noted that Auxiliary Police Officers during the 9/11 incident were, for a time, the only police presence in the park, and during the blackout APO''s assisted relieved regulars police officers so that more of them would be available to deal with pressing police situations at the time.<br />7. Being an Auxiliary Police Officer in Central Park is a fine way to learn the geography of Central Park! The park is a great place with many faces. Its diverse terrain appears different, depending on season or even time of day.<br />The Central Park Precinct is UNLIKE any other precinct in New York City. It is the SAFEST Police Precinct in the NYPD. There are no residents. It receives thousands of visitors every day from around the world, many of whom will ask to take a photo with you!!<br />8. Allows you to part of a great community and meet many new people (see above).<br />9. Allows you to be apart of the greatest and most famous Police Department in the world.<br /><br />Being apart of the NYPD, is like "having front row tickets to the greatest show on earth!!!! "<br /><br />SO WHAT DOES THE NYPD REQUIRE OF YOU??<br /><br />NYPD REQUIRES:<br /><br />1. You are a U.S. citizen or Permanant Resident (Green Card).<br />2. LIVE OR WORK in New York City (i.e. Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, Bronx, Staten Island.)<br />3. Be of Good Moral Character. This includes having not been arrested and/or convicted of a felony (you MUST submit to a FBI and NYPD finger print background check)!!<br />4. Over the age of 18.<br />5. Good Health<br />6. Physically Fit<br />7. Read and write English.<br /><br />WHAT DOES THE CENTRAL PARK PRECINCT AUXILIARY POLICE UNIT REQUIRE OF YOU?<br /><br />1. *****Willingness to commit to 4-5 hour tour ONE NIGHT A WEEK. from about 7pm-10pm (weekend tours are available). *****<br />2. Understand that the NYPD Auxiliary Police is a paramilitary organization. That means that like the regular police force, we have a hierarchy (Auxiliary Police Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain, Deputy Inspector).<br />3. Have a STRONG desire to meet new people and HAVE FUN. Again, if you''re not having fun, there''s no point in being in this program. This IS a volunteer program after all.<br /><br />HOW DO YOU APPLY?<br /><br />E-mail the Central Park Precinct Auxiliary Police Unit Recruitment Section at: <a href="mailto:AUXDINYPD@aol.com">AUXDINYPD@aol.com </a><br />Or Call: <br />Deputy Inspector Roger Thomas, Commanding Officer at:<br />1-718-938-8866<br /><br /><br />In your email please INCLUDE<br /><br />1.

Bouldering, an offshoot of traditional rock climbing that is concentrated on climbing challenges under 10 feet in height, is experiencing a revival in the United States, particularly in New York City. It is one of few mentally and physically challenging sports that can be practiced inside the confines of the city. To play, all you need is a chalk bag to keep you hands dry on slippery slopes, a fall pad, which is like a small mattress that goes under you to protect you if you fall, and hopefully a buddy to spot you while you climb. Bouldering challenges are broken up into "problems" which reflect the dual mental and physical nature of the sport. Some climbs have the possibility of eliminates, which refers to specific handicaps undertaken during the climb to make it artificially more challenging. An example of this might be not using an obvious handhold during the ascent.</p>\r\n<p>Some of the more popular locations for bouldering are Worthless Boulder, located near 110th Street; Cat Rock, near <a title="Wollman Rink" href="http://www.centralpark.com/guide/attractions/wollman-rink.html">Wollman Rink</a>; and Rat Rock, near the <a title="Heckscher Ballfields" href="http://www.centralpark.com/guide/attractions/heckscher-ballfields.html">Heckscher Ballfields</a>.

The forty foot wide Mall, flanked by its majestic rows of American Elms, provides the perfect place for a leisurely stroll in any season, especially the fall. One can easily imagine the scene a century ago, women with parasols and men in top hats perambulating towards the Concert Ground that stood adjacent to its northern end. On the left is the historic Naumberg Bandshell. Built in 1923 it has been the stage for concerts by an eclectic array of artists, from John Philip Sousa to the Grateful Dead, and it is still the home of an annual series of summer concerts.</p>\r\n<p>Walking south beneath the cathedral-like canopy brings us to an area known as the Literary Walk that is populated with a series of sculptures depicting popular figures in world literature and music. Personalities represented include Shakespeare, Victor Herbert, Robert Burns and Ludwig van Beethoven, as well as Sir Walter Scott. The end of the Promenade brings us to the park Drive which we follow down and to the right which brings us to The Carousel.</p>\r\n<p>The Central Park Carousel opened in 1871 and was powered by a blind mule and a horse which walked a treadmill in an underground pit. It almost immediately became one of the park&rsquo;s most popular attractions and remains so to this day, with almost 250,000 riders a year. Visitors will want to check out the wrought iron fence that surrounds the open Carousel sides; small, brightly-painted horses are depicted on a band around the fence. The Carousel is open seven days a week, weather permitting, and for $1.25 you can climb aboard for an exciting three-and-a-half minute ride.</p>\r\n<p><center style="page-break-after: always;"></center></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>From the Carousel we walk southeast past the Chess and Checkers House. Built in 1952 as a gift of philanthropist Bernard Baruch, the octagonal red and cream colored brick structure has indoor as well as outdoor tables that attract play&shy;ers of all ages and prowess. A pergola offers plenty of shade. Continuing on we pass Wollman Skating Rink built in 1949 it has been a success from the day it opened - over 300,000 skaters glided across the ice in its first year of operation and in the summer it is the home of the Victorian Gardens Amusement Park.</p>\r\n<p>Walking south and then west from the rink we pass the Hallett Nature Preserve to our right. Originally set aside as a bird sanctuary in 1934 this four acre plot of land is bounded on three sides by the Pond and is only yards away from the bustle of Central Park South and the Plaza Hotel some fifty feet above. It is the permanent and transitory home of dozens of species of birds as well as rabbits, raccoons and even woodchucks. Continuing past the Preserve brings us to the final stop on our virtual tour &mdash; Gapstow Bridge and the Pond.  <br /> <br />Gapstow Bridge is a lovely construct of stone that stretches gracefully over the north end of the Pond and offers one of the most picturesque views in all of Manhattan. Looking out over the bucolic splendor of the Pond, with its gently curving shoreline and overhanging trees our gaze is drawn upwards to the manmade spectacle above, the New York skyline extending over Grand Army Plaza. The Pond is most remarkable for being so close to the clamor of the city, yet thanks to the brilliance of the landscape design by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, it is completely removed into a world all its own. A few short feet from Fifth Ave. a park visitor can easily imagine themselves somewhere in the Catskills, far from the gasp and clatter of the metropolis above.  <br /> <br /><a href="http://www.centralparkbb.com/tour_1.htm" target="_blank">Printable Map of Tour 1</a></p>', 'CentralPark.com - Your first stop for information on Central Park and The Central Park Zoo!

Maybe, but if this scene isn\\''t reality, it is now a virtual reality, thanks to Tiger Woods and EA Games. </p>\r\n<br /><br /><img height=\\"36\\" alt=\\"golf_headline3.gif\\" src=\\"http://www.centralpark.com/updata/Image/golf/golf_headline3.gif\\" width=\\"300\\" border=\\"0\\" /> <br /><br />\r\n<table style=\\"MARGIN: 0px 5px 5px 0px\\" cellspacing=\\"3\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" align=\\"left\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" border=\\"0\\">\r\n    <tbody>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td align=\\"center\\">\r\n            <table cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" align=\\"left\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" border=\\"0\\">\r\n                <tbody>\r\n                    <tr>\r\n                        <td align=\\"center\\"><img height=\\"135\\" alt=\\"lake.jpg\\" src=\\"http://www.centralpark.com/updata/Image/golf/lake.jpg\\" width=\\"180\\" align=\\"baseline\\" border=\\"0\\" /></td>\r\n                    </tr>\r\n                    <tr>\r\n                        <td align=\\"center\\">\r\n                        <p align=\\"left\\"><font size=\\"1\\"><strong>The Central Park Lake. <br />Just another tricky water hazard <br />found in Tiger Woods PGA Tour \\''06.</strong> </font></p>\r\n                        </td>\r\n                    </tr>\r\n                </tbody>\r\n            </table>\r\n            </td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n    </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>With the release of Tiger Woods PGA Tour 06 Central Park Course EA gives all of us, avid duffers and tyros alike, the chance to play a round of golf that takes you up and down the width and breadth of Central Park.

Runners in the 1970s would complete loops through the park drive area, which could be grueling. Less than half of participants finished the race in these early years since the loops covered some of the most exhausting ground of the park, including steep hills.</p>\r\n<p>In today''s marathon, which is the traditional length of 26 miles, runners begin on Staten Island and end at Tavern on the Green in Central Park. To watch runners cross the finish line at <a title="Tavern on the Green" href="http://www.centralpark.com/guide/attractions/tavern-on-the-green.html">Tavern on the Green</a> you must purchase tickets, as space is limited.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style="background: #efefef; color: green; padding: 2px;"><span style="background: #efefef; color: green; padding: 2px;"><span style="background: #efefef; color: green; padding: 2px;">{{ADSPACE_300_250}}</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p>The race leaves the boroughs and enters Manhattan at mile 16. From there it goes down Fifth Avenue, eventually crosses southern Central Park, loops out again, and reenters the park at Columbus Circle. The marathon usually takes place the first weekend in November. Large sections of the park are closed to pedestrians and cars to accommodate the race. In recent years, the race has been renamed the ING New York City Marathon because of ING''s sponsorship of the event.</p>\r\n<p>The Central Park portions of the marathon take a tremendous amount of work to organize. The New York Roadunners Club is primarily responsible for the activities at Tavern on the Green, including helping runners and family members find each other after the race is over. If you are interested in viewing the marathon, there are a few spots in the park that are worthwhile, including the area near 67th Street.</p>', 'Running on CentralPark.com - Your first stop for information on Central Park and The Central Park Zoo!

It was replaced with a simple wood and pipe railing bridge in1935, but its more recent restoration returned to the bridge the grandeur it once had.</p>\r\n<p><span style="color: #008000;"><br /></span></p>\r\n<h3>Balcony Bridge (77th street)</h3>\r\n<p>Made primarily of schist and sandstone, the Balcony Bridge was named for its two small balconies that offer resting points for those wishing to stop and take in the view.  It was built in 1860 and is decorated with quatrefoil cutouts.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><a href="http://www.centralpark.com/guide/attractions/bridges-of-central-park/bow-bridge.html">Bow Bridge</a> (74th street)</h3>\r\n<p>The stately Bow Bridge was fashioned by Calvert Vaux and Jacob Wrey Mould in a Classic Greek style with Renaissance Gothic foliate designs.  At a length of 60 feet, it provides a pathway from the Ramble to Cherry Hill.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div>{{ADSPACE_300_250}}</div>\r\n<h3>Dalehead Arch (64th street)</h3>\r\n<p>This sandstone and brownstone arch also includes the quatrefoil cutout design that appears on many of the original 19th century bridges in Central Park.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Eaglevale Bridge (77th street)</h3>\r\n<p>Designed by the architect Josiah Cleveland Cady, this gneiss bridge was constructed in 1890.  At one time, it provided a path to the Ladies'' Pond, which has been replaced with a playground.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><a href="http://www.centralpark.com/guide/attractions/bridges-of-central-park/gapstow-bridge.html">Gapstow Bridge</a> (62nd street)</h3>\r\n<p>From the Gapstow Bridge, one can see skaters at Wollman''s Rink in winter, the Victorian Gardens in summer, and the Plaza Hotel and city skyscrapers in any season.  This 76 foot long bridge was constructed by Howard and Caudwell in 1896 and is made of Manhattan schist.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Glade Arch (78th street)</h3>\r\n<p>Glade Arch, one of earliest bridges designed by Calvert Vaux, is made of New Brunswick sandstone. In 1980 a large portion of the fence posts were damaged by a snow plow leading to a complete restoration the following year.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Glen Span Bridge (102nd street)</h3>\r\n<p>This gneiss arch that provides an entrance to the Ravine was first constructed of simple wood 1865.  It was later replaced with the more enduring stone and sits east of the Pool and west of the Loch.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Gothic Bridge (94th street)</h3>\r\n<p>The beautiful Central Park Gothic Bridge was made of steel and cast iron in 1864, when it was designed by Vaux.  This bridge gets its name from the Gothic Cathedral style curves of the ironwork on the spandrels.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Pine Bank Bridge (62nd street)</h3>\r\n<p>Another cast iron bridge, Pink Bank Bridge extends towards Heckscher Playground and was first built in1861 by J.B. and W.W. Cornell Ironworks.  It was then renovated in 1984, as it had fallen into disrepair over the years.  Its intricate designs make it a must-see for those interested in architecture.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Reservoir Bridge (85th street)</h3>\r\n<p>One of the two bridges that are situated near the Reservoir, this bridge consists of a wooden footpath and is decorated with elegant floral scrolls and spiraling leaves along all 38 feet.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Reservoir Bridge (94th street)</h3>\r\n<p>This 15-foot cast iron bridge is located near the North Gatehouse, and bears a striking resemblance to the Gothic Bridge because of its design.  This bridge was designed by Calvert Vaux and constructed in 1864.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Terrace Bridge (72nd street)</h3>\r\n<p>Bethesda Terrace, inspired by the designs of the Palace of Versailles, was envisioned as one of the focal points of the entire Park by its creators.  Fashioned out of New Brunswick sandstone, the Terrace stands at 16 feet high and 29 feet wide.  A highly popular Central Park attraction, the Terrace is also known for containing the Bethesda Fountain.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0 0 20px; text-align: right;"><small>&mdash; Jesse M.

Every year, 25 million people visit the park for vacation, recreation or even as a brief respite from business. With our incredibly connected world today, it&rsquo;s inevitable that park-goers will want to get online during their visit.<span> </span></p>\r\n<p class="c1 c6">Throughout New York City, the Parks and Recreation department is setting up AT&amp;T Wi-Fi hot spots to enable greater connectivity. The five-year initiative will provide access at 26 locations throughout all five boroughs. Four of these locations are within Central Park.</p>\r\n<p class="c1 c6">In addition, there are other groups throughout the city that are working to provide free online access such as NYCwireless. Some of these locations will be close to the park, but not inside it, so coverage may not be as reliable.</p>\r\n<p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0"><strong>How to Get Online During Your Visit</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class="c1 c6">For the best chances of getting online, visit one of the AT&amp;T hot spots. They are located at:</p>\r\n<p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0">&middot; </span><span class="c3 c0"><strong>Mineral Springs Pavilion</strong>:&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Located between 69th St. and 70th St. on the west side of the park right next to Sheep Meadow, Mineral Springs Pavilion offers park-goers a place to relax and grab a bite to eat. The eatery is operated by Le Pain Quotidien, a Belgian restaurant, and it serves bread, soup, sandwiches and other light fare. The terrace sits up to 100 people, making it the perfect place to sit and snack while checking your email or catching up on some quick business.</span></p>\r\n<p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0">&middot;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c0"><strong>Rumsey Playfield</strong>:&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Host of the Central Park SummerStage concerts, Rumsey Playfield hosts thousands of music-goers every year. The free Wi-Fi in this area is available June through September, in conjunction with the SummerStage series. Rumsey Playfield is on the east side of the park, and is accessible via E. 69th St.</span></p>\r\n<p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0">&middot;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c0"><strong>Central Park Zoo</strong>:&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">New York&rsquo;s famed Central Park Zoo is home to a wide range of wild animals, and now, you can hop online and play social games on your iPad or do more complex work such as attend an online learning course on web development or learn</span><span class="c0"><a class="c5" href="http://www.shopwpthemes.com/how-to-guides/how-to-install-wordpress-on-bluehost/">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="c2 c0"><a class="c5" href="http://www.shopwpthemes.com/how-to-guides/how-to-install-wordpress-on-bluehost/">how to install WordPress on BlueHost</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in between animal watching. The Zoo is on the southeast side of the park near E. 64th St.</span></p>\r\n<p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0">&middot;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c0"><strong>Tavern on the Green</strong>:&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Tavern on the Green is not only a dining hot spot, but now it&rsquo;s a Wi-Fi hot spot as well. The restaurant is currently undergoing a renovation, but is slated to reopen in December of 2013. It is located on the west side between W. 66th St. and W. 67th St.</span></p>\r\n<p class="c1"><span class="c0">To log on at any of these locations, look for the network name &ldquo;attwifi&rdquo; on your computer and click on it.

Most of these groups are devoted to providing wireless in one area of the city, such as Union Square or Bryant Park. However, NYCwireless is one group looking at the city as a whole. You can check out their website (</span><span class="c2 c0"><a class="c5" href="http://www.nycwireless.net/">www.nycwireless.net</a></span><span class="c0">) to view a list of hot spots in the area, some of which are in the vicinity of Central Park. For example, the Apple store on Fifth Ave. next to the park is one place where you can get free Wi-Fi.</span></p>\r\n<p class="c1"><span class="c0">In addition, you can check out the Open WiFi NYC site (</span><span class="c2 c0"><a class="c5" href="http://www.openwifinyc.com/">www.openwifinyc.com</a></span><span class="c0">), which lists free hot spots throughout New York City.</span></p>\r\n<p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0"><strong>Follow the People for the Best Access</strong></span></p>\r\n<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Overall, if you&rsquo;re looking to get online during your visit to Central Park, it makes the most sense to stick to the most densely populated areas in the park, which are generally on the southern half. You can also look for restaurants and cafes along the border of the park which are likely to provide free access.</span></p>\r\n<p class="c1" style="text-align: right;"><span class="c0">-By Kathryn Sucich</span></p>\r\n<p class="c1 c6" style="text-align: left;"><em><span class="c0 c4">Kathryn Sucich is a freelance writer and fan of the latest technology for both business and personal use.

In the spring and summer the rink becomes home to the <a href="http://www.centralpark.com/pages/attractions/victorian-gardens.html">Victorian Gardens</a> amusement park, a beautiful evocation of a quaint country carnival with rides and attractions for the whole family.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<table border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="0" align="right" bgcolor="#ffffff">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="center">\r\n<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" bgcolor="#ffffff">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="center"><img style="width: 220px; height: 138px;" src="http://www.centralpark.com/updata/Image/attractions/imagine.jpg" border="0" alt="Imagine Mosaic" width="220" height="138" align="middle" /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="right"><a href="http://centralparkblogger.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><em>John B.

John Lennon had taken many walks with his wife and young son through the friendly confines of nearby Central Park. Long a favorite son of his adopted city John Lennon wasn''t simply New York''s Beatle, he was, for many, the embodiment of the spirit on which city had been built. One half urbane cynic and one half romantic dreamer, he unabashedly embraced the disparate parts which, as every New Yorker knows, combine to form a uniquely gifted, passionate individual. And city.&nbsp; The Imagine Mosaic has become a gathering place for fans of Mr.Lennon from all over the world and it is here that you can almost always find someone strumming a guitar to the tune of one of his many song.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><center style="page-break-after: always;"></center></p>\r\n<div style="padding: 10px 0pt; text-align: center;"><img title="Top 10 Greatest Place in Central Park" src="http://www.centralpark.com/pages/top10/top-10-places-logo.png" alt="Top 10 Greatest Place in Central Park" width="194" height="56" /></div>\r\n<table border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="0" align="right" bgcolor="#ffffff">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="center">\r\n<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" bgcolor="#ffffff">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="center"><img style="width: 220px; height: 165px;" src="http://www.centralpark.com/updata/Image/attractions/con_garden.jpg" border="0" alt="Conservatory Gardens" width="220" height="165" align="middle" /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="right"><a href="http://centralparkblogger.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><em>John B.

The Conservatory Garden itself is filled with a myriad of plant life, from carefully cultivated heirloom roses to the most common of indigenous flowers, while portions of the grounds are delineated by hedges of English yew, barberry, Korean holly and the serendipitously named "Manhattan." The Garden itself is divided into three distinct sections, each representing its own specific style.

The 106-acre body of water is 40 feet deep and holds over a billion gallons of water. Once a critical part of the city''s fresh water system it was disconnected as an active component since the new water tunnel was opened in 1991. It is probably best known now as home to the 1.58 mile running track that surrounds it. The Reservoir is also currently the subject of a very public debate as several different plans are considered for its future; these include fishing piers, a marina, ball fields, restaurants and beaches. Hopefully the debate will rage on indefinitely and the current configuration will remain as it is.</p>\r\n<table border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="0" align="right" bgcolor="#ffffff">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="center">\r\n<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" bgcolor="#ffffff">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="center"><img style="width: 220px; height: 147px;" src="http://www.centralpark.com/updata/Image/attractions/Bow Brige.jpg" border="0" alt="Bow Bridge" width="220" height="147" align="middle" /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="right"><a href="http://centralparkblogger.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><em>John B.

Stebbins designed the statue to celebrate the new Croton Aqueduct which not only fed the fountain, but also supplied fresh water to a city that had long been plagued by infectious diseases caused by an unsafe water supply.<br />Bethesda Terrace has long been one of the most popular meeting spots in Central Park and is also the most popular film set in the park.&nbsp; Films such as "Ransom", "Home Alone II", "One Fine Day" and "Godspell" have all utilized the beautifully designed architecture of the Terrace, along with the view of the Lake and Boathouse, as a backdrop for their cinematic efforts.<br />Bethesda Terrace is also home to a variety of park performers, the most famous of which is Thoth, the mystical violinist and the subject of an eponymous Oscar winning short film by Sarah Kernochan.</p>\r\n<table border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="0" align="right" bgcolor="#ffffff">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="center">\r\n<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" bgcolor="#ffffff">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="center"><img style="width: 220px; height: 139px;" src="http://www.centralpark.com/updata/Image/attractions/carousel.jpg" border="0" alt="Carousel" width="220" height="139" align="right" /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="right"><a href="http://centralparkblogger.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><em>John B.

The original park carousel opened in 1871 and was powered by a blind mule and a horse which walked a treadmill in an underground pit. It almost immediately became one of the park''s most popular attractions and remains so to this day, with almost 250,000 riders a year. Originally the park commissioners had frowned upon commercial enterprises in the Park, but they eventually saw the popular attractions as valuable assets. They also recognized the not insignificant fees that the city earned on the carousel''s operation as a welcome source of needed revenue.</p>\r\n<table border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="0" align="right" bgcolor="#ffffff">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="center">\r\n<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" bgcolor="#ffffff">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="center"><img style="width: 220px; height: 284px;" src="http://www.centralpark.com/updata/Image/attractions/belvedere1.jpg" border="0" alt="Belvedere Castle" width="220" height="284" align="right" /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="right"><a href="http://centralparkblogger.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><em>John B.

Keep an eye out for her, she blends in well with the surrounding trees. The face of the two-toed sloth is quite flat and hairless. Its eyes are small, set within black rings, and the ears are almost completely hidden beneath the long, bristly, gray-brown coat. Her tail is little more than a stump. The front legs are slightly longer than the hind legs, and the feet have long curved claws, but only on the second and third toes of the front feet, which is why it is called a two-toed sloth. They have long gray or brown hair that blends in well with the surrounding environment. This hair curves in the opposite direction of most other mammals: from the stomach to the back. Their hair is often covered with a coat of blue-green algae during the rainy season. This algae provides camouflage.<br /><br /><strong>Zoo Sloth Habitat:</strong> Matilda has the entire Tropic building to navigate around. She is excellent at hiding. Most people get to see her towards the end of the day when she come out of hiding and slowly moves to her feeding area, over the beach.<br /><br /><strong>What do they eat:</strong>&nbsp; Sloths have large, chambered stomachs to help digest plant material. Digestion can take as long as a month. In the wild, two-toed sloths eat leaves, fruit, flowers, and buds. Their low rate of metabolism enables them to live on relatively little food.&nbsp; Sloths appear to be strictly herbivores, feeding on leaves, young shoots, flowers and fruit.&nbsp; They don''t drink but get their water from eating juicy leaves &amp; licking dewdrops. In the CPZ, she is fed a variety of greens (spinach is favored), carrots, yams, apple pieces, and some canned primate diet.<br /><br /><strong>Life span:</strong>&nbsp; Sloths in captivity can live over 30 years.&nbsp; The life span in the wild is closer to 12 to 16 years.     \r\n<table border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="0" align="right" bgcolor="#ffffff">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="center">\r\n<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" bgcolor="#ffffff">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="center"><img style="border: 0pt none;" src="http://www.centralpark.com/updata/Image/matilda.jpg" alt="ALT TEXT GOES HERE" width="168" height="120" /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="right"><a href="http://www.judithwolfe.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><em>Judith Wolfe</em> </span></a></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="center">\r\n<p align="left"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><strong>Look for Matilda in the trees</strong><a href="http://www.judithwolfe.com"><strong><br /></strong> </a></span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<br /><strong>Threats:</strong> Deforestation. In some parts of South America, two-toed sloths are hunted for their meat. Predators, beside people, include large snakes, harpy eagles and other large birds. Jaguars and ocelots are a danger when the sloth is on the ground.<br /><br /><strong>Fun Facts:</strong> Two-toed sloths, such as the CPZ&rsquo;s Matilda, are nocturnal. Sloths have the most variable and lowest body temperature of any mammal. Due to her species&rsquo; low metabolism and low body temperature, she needs about 15 hours of sleep a day. She is likely to stay in the trees most of the time, coming down about once a week to release feces and urine. This fecal material, which may weigh as much as 2 pounds, is high in nutrients and helps to fertilize the surrounding plants.&nbsp; They spend so much time upside down that they are the only mammals whose fur is parted and flows from belly to back.&nbsp; This allows run-off of water during rainstorms.&nbsp; Sloths are also the only mammals that can turn their heads about 180 degrees in both directions, an adaptation shared with only a few other groups of animals &ndash; owls and some prosimians. They do not have incisors and crop leaves with their hard lips. Their teeth grow continuously, as they are worn down by the grinding of their food. Sloths have primitive peg-like teeth. They have a total of ten upper and eight lower molars.&nbsp; These teeth lack enamel and grow continuously. They do most things upside down: eat, sleep (an average of 15 hours per day), mate, and give birth. Because of their upside down life, many of their internal organs (liver, stomach, spleen, pancreas) are in different positions from other mammals. Sloths sometimes let out a cry or hissing sound.</p>\r\n<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>', 'CentralPark.com -  Your first stop for information on Central Park, New York City and The Central Park Zoo, 830 5th Ave. New York, NY 1002.

This is due to a veritable wall of trees and shrubs, as well as the inspired landscaping of Olmsted and Vaux, which placed the pond well below street level. This entrance was originally designed to handle most of the traffic into the park, and continues to do so until this day.</div>\r\n<br />\r\n<h3>4. <a href="http://www.centralpark.com/pages/attractions/bridges-of-central-park/gapstow-bridge.html">Gapstow Bridge <img src="http://www.centralpark.com/updata/Image/walkingtours/gapstow-bridge.jpg" border="0" alt="Gapstow Bridge" width="150" height="113" align="right" /></a></h3>\r\n<div>This is the second version of this bridge to stretch over the tranquil waters.

It is also easily the most photographed with early morning fashion shoots a regular occurrence and film crews visiting on an almost weekly basis.</div>\r\n<br />\r\n<h3>22. <a href="http://www.centralpark.com/pages/attractions/mall.html">The Mall <img src="http://www.centralpark.com/updata/Image/walkingtours/the-mall.jpg" border="0" alt="Central Park Mall" width="150" height="113" align="right" /></a></h3>\r\n<div>Designed by Vaux and Olmsted as a &ldquo;grand promenade&rdquo;, the forty foot wide Mall is flanked by its majestic rows of American Elms, providing the perfect place for a leisurely stroll in any season to admire the cathedral-like ambience. This is another of the Park''s most photo friendly scenes.</div>\r\n<br />\r\n<h3>23. <a href="http://www.centralpark.com/pages/attractions/dairy.html">The Dairy</a></h3>\r\n<div>The Dairy serves as a general visitor center with information on the design of Central Park, as well as current Park events and programs. It houses a reference library where researchers are welcome to explore the colorful history of the park''s construction. In addition, The Dairy serves as the official Central Park gift store with maps, guides, history books, and a line of mugs, key chains, T-shirts, and caps especially designed for the Central Park Conservancy.</div>\r\n<br />\r\n<h3>24. <a href="http://www.centralpark.com/pages/attractions/wollman-rink.html">Wollman Rink</a></h3>\r\n<div>Ice skating in Central Park is easily one of the most picturesque activities to be enjoyed on a winter''s night. Unlike the somewhat overwhelming confines of the Rockefeller Center rink, you can actually see stars at the Wollman rink. During the spring and summer months the rink becomes Victorian Gardens amusement Park.</div>\r\n<div class="buttons">\r\n<div class="back"><a title="Go back to Arts and Architecture Tour Guide Page 3" href="/guide/tours/walking/self-guided/arts-and-architecture_3.html"><img title="Go back to Arts and Architecture Tour Guide Page 3" src="http://www.centralpark.com/usr/media/tours/go-back.gif" alt="Go back to Arts and Architecture Tour Guide Page 3" /></a></div>\r\n<div class="toRight continue">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class="clearer">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class="separator">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class="jumeirah"><a href="http://ads.centralpark.com/www/delivery/ck.php?bannerid=152" target="_blank"><img title="Jumeirah Essex House" src="http://ads.centralpark.com/www/delivery/avw.php?bannerid=152" alt="Jumeirah Essex House" width="131" height="69" /></a></div>\r\n<ul class="links margin10">\r\n<li class="virtual"><a title="See the virtual tour" href="page.php?pid=299">Take the Interactive Tour</a></li>\r\n<li class="map"><a title="Download Walking Tour pdf map" href="page.php?pid=304">Download Walking Tour map</a></li>\r\n<li class="podcast"><a title="Download Walking Tour podcast" href="page.php?pid=301">Download Audio Tour<br /></a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class="separator">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>', 'The Arts and Architecture Tour of Central Park includes all the essential attractions covered by the Family Tour, including the Zoo and Children''s Zoo, Balto, Conservatory Water, Loeb Boathouse, Bethesda Terrace and Fountain, the Mall, Carousel, Wollman Rink', 'arts, architecture, arts and architecture tour, walking tour, attractions, children zoo, balto, conservatory water, Loeb Boathouse, Bethesda Terrace and Fountain, the Mall, the Dairy, the Carousel and Wollman Rink', 0.00, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, '/usr/media/tours/tours.css', '', 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 'Arts and Architecture Tour', 'Arts and Architecture Tour', 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

The criteria used in the selection process were admittedly biased, but we did use the results of the best Central Park movie poll that we''ve been running for the past two months.&nbsp; Other factors in judging the results were how the park was depicted in the movie, and, of course, the quality of the film itself. 	Let us know what you think of our choices.</p>\r\n<h2 class="top10title">10. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108395/" target="_blank">A Troll in Central Park</a></h2>\r\n<p>In terms of pure fantasy the best example of the park in cinema would be <strong>&ldquo;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108395/" target="_blank">A Troll in Central Park</a>&rdquo;</strong>, Don Bluth director, 1994. It''s an animated fairytale about a troll, named Stanley, that is banished to New York City for having a green thumb, the punishment being the assumption that there is no greenery to be found amidst Manhattan''s concrete canyons. Much to his delight, however, little Stanley finds himself dropped in Central Park, in mid-spring. The park is drawn beautifully, with remarkable respect given to geographic detail. The park becomes a final battle ground between powerful forces for good and evil. Of course the forces of good prevail and the park becomes an Eden-like garden in the process.</p>\r\n<h2 class="top10title">9. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091167/" target="_blank">Hannah And Her Sisters</a></h2>\r\n<p>It is difficult to imagine a Woody Allen movie shot in New York that doesn''t include scenes in Central Park. From his very first film - <strong>"<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065063/" target="_blank">Take The Money And Run</a>"</strong> to the more recent <strong>"<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0313792/" target="_blank">Anything Else</a>"</strong> it seems that every one of Mr. Allen''s films contains scenes shot around the park. While it never quite seems that the locale is essential to the action taking place (they are almost always scenes of exposition between characters) it does become apparent that the park is a crucial element in the urban landscape as imagined by the director. So we''ve picked <strong>"<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091167/" target="_blank">Hannah And Her Sisters</a>"</strong> as the Woody Allen entry in the Central Park Top Ten. One of his best movies, it is also representative of six decades of cinematic work featuring Central Park as a movie sound stage.</p>\r\n<h2 class="top10title">8. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087755/" target="_blank">The Muppets Take Manhattan</a></h2>\r\n<p>In the 1980''s Central Park was just beginning to go through the transformation that has produced the pastoral gem we have today. After years of neglect the grime and graffiti of misuse and under funding was scraped off and the beautiful park we now enjoy every day began to re-emerge. The first movie to really celebrate this transformation was <strong>"<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087755/" target="_blank">The Muppets Take Manhattan</a>"</strong> There are gorgeously pastoral scenes of Kermit and Miss Piggy in Central Park that convey a sense of bright optimism as the two share a sunny day around the brightly lit landscape. The park is once again proudly portrayed as the lovely center of the city that we know today.</p>\r\n<p><center style="page-break-after: always;"></center></p>\r\n<h2 class="top10title">7. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0461770/" target="_blank">Enchanted</a></h2>\r\n<p>When you take a fairytale princess out of the animated world of make believe and drop her into the gritty reality of Manhattan you have the makings of a very entertaining movie. The perfect place for the city to meet the wonderfully imagined universe of Disney filmmakers is Central Park, and the movie <strong>"<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0461770/" target="_blank">Enchanted</a>"</strong> is the perfect product of that union. From the narration by Julie Andrews to the whimsically engaging character of the Princess as portrayed by Amy Adams director Kevin Lima captures all the magic of Central Park by staging production numbers in various iconic sites around the park. The biggest of these is an amazingly choreographed song and dance that transforms Bethesda Fountain into the definition of the word Hollywood Spectacular. Central park never looked more magical.</p>\r\n<h2 class="top10title">6. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098635/" target="_blank">When Harry Met Sally</a></h2>\r\n<p><strong>"<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098635/" target="_blank">When Harry Met Sally</a>"</strong> - if not the quintessential Manhattan love story, then certainly the quintessential Central Park love story. A case of boy meets girl, boy estranges girl through inexcusably boorish behavior and then boy slowly discovers self, along with true feelings for girl, through a series of wryly drawn, semiotically witty scenes cast against a romantically understated backdrop. Sally''s luncheon with her friends at the Central Park Boathouse restaurant is a microcosm of 1980''s feminism - underwear incendiary defiance meets droll relationship realism. Their autumn stroll along the Mall is the perfect backdrop for the subtle change in their relationship as it slowly evolves into friendship. And the Temple of Dendor scene finishes the Central Park trifecta as Harry starts to realize that his latent expectations are needs that have to be acknowledged. Nora Ephron''s brilliant script captures the evolution of love between Harry and Sally, and Central Park provides the perfect canvas on which to paint this touchingly funny urban romance.</p>\r\n<h2 class="top10title">5. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058756/" target="_blank">The World of Henry Orient</a></h2>\r\n<p>One example of Central Park in which the park plays a supporting dramatic role itself would be <strong>"<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058756/" target="_blank">The World of Henry Orient</a>"</strong>, 1964, directed by George Roy Hill. In this movie the park is seen in autumn, a cheerful, pretty landscape that provides the back drop for the afternoon frolics of two young girls, played by Tippy Walker and Merrie Spaeth. It&rsquo;s the scene of a day long fantasy, chasing over and under bridges, around lakes and statues that bonds the two together. It is also the trysting place of Peter Sellers and Paula Prentiss, which the girls discover to Seller''s everlasting chagrin. Later in the movie, when Spaeth is searching for her missing friend, we see her wondering through a snow covered park, a bleak and barren landscape, all grey frost and frozen ground. George Roy Hill uses the changing season and background of the landscape to echo the dramatic conflict taking place between the characters.</p>\r\n<p><center style="page-break-after: always;"></center></p>\r\n<h2 class="top10title">4. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0240890/" target="_blank">Serendipity</a></h2>\r\n<p>Another example of Central Park as one of the most romantic settings anywhere in New York City is <strong>"<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0240890/" target="_blank">Serendipity</a>"</strong> starring John Cusack and Kate Beckingsale. The plot revolves around a chance meeting between the two at Bloomingdale''s while shopping for gloves. They wind up having a magical evening which includes skating in a gorgeously decorated Wollman Rink. Besides the evocative shots of them gliding around the rink there are amazing shots of the rink decorated for Christmas with a backdrop of the Manhattan skyline above that are absolutely breathtaking. The final shot also takes place at the rink where Cusack is finally reunited with Beckingsale at the movie''s admittedly unlikely, manipulative and totally irresistible climax. The film paints a beautiful portrait of Central Park by night that is almost haunting in its idealized winter splendor.</p>\r\n<h2 class="top10title">3. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104431/" target="_blank">Home Alone 2</a></h2>\r\n<p>One of the most popular children''s films to use Central Park as a backdrop is <strong>"<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104431/" target="_blank">Home Alone 2</a>"</strong> starring Macauley Culkin, Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. Scenes include Wollman Rink and Kevin eluding his pursuers by hiding in a horse drawn carriage, Kevin running around Bethesda Fountain but perhaps the most memorable shot that is set in the movie is the one with Brenda Fricker giving her portrayal of a rather eccentric park character that is obsessed with pigeons. The scene is set at the beautiful Inscope Arch which runs beneath the Park Drive at the southeast entrance and connects the Central Park Zoo to the Pond. The Bad Guys (Pesci and Stern) are ultimately thwarted in their attempts to do away with young Kevin by being showered with bread crumbs and then inundated with hungry pigeons. The shot is eerily, yet beautifully, lit and gives the park a magical feel, even while it is showcasing some of its least notable denizens.</p>\r\n<h2 class="top10title">2. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040705/" target="_blank">Portrait of Jennie</a></h2>\r\n<p><strong>"<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040705/" target="_blank">Portrait of Jennie</a>"</strong> from 1949 is still one of the most romantically magical films ever shot in Central Park. Taken from a popular novel by Robert Nathan it is the story of Eben Adams (played by Joseph Cotton), a struggling artist that can''t seem to find his muse. One night, on a stroll through Central Park, he meets Jennie Appleton, a precocious pre-teen played somewhat unconvincingly by a decidedly post-pubescent Jennifer Jones. Suspension of disbelief aside, this is a lovely movie that, quite uncharacteristically for the era, is shot extensively in Central Park. Shots of the Dairy, the Mall and a lovely sequence filmed on the Pond evoke a New York that seems almost sepia-tinted sixty years later. The ethereal nature of Eben''s meetings with Jennie (she seems to age by five or six years in between seasonal meetings) adds to the timeless nature of the the park settings. It seems that it could be 1859, 1909, 1949... The movie is a timeless evocation of Central Park as a world separate from the city that surrounds it, a place where the improbable is possible.</p>\r\n<p><center style="page-break-after: always;"></center></p>\r\n<h2 class="top10title">1. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079261/" target="_blank">Hair</a></h2>\r\n<p>The most romantic view of the park can be found in the movie adaptation of the musical <strong>"<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079261/" target="_blank">Hair</a>"</strong>, 1980, directed by Milos Forman. The film opens with an extended version of the song "Aquarius" that has Twyla Tharp choreographed dancers writhing about the lush autumn landscape, along with police horses that prance in step to the music. It is a wild and joyful place filled with hippies and hope. It is their home, a place filled with promise and life; counter culture experimentation throwing down an exuberant challenge to the concrete canyon dwellers that surround it. It is, of course, wildly simplistic and naive, but still it seduces you into thinking that even if it wasn''t exactly like that it should have been. For that matter it convinces you that that is the way it should still be. There are long shots that include the leafy vistas of the fall in New York and upwardly angled cameras that frame each character against the skyline. This is place you wanted to come to when you first heard about New York. It''s a place where people dance and sing and experience life vividly and viscerally. The place you never quite found. The one you still dream about.</p>', 'Movies have been shot in Central Park for just about a century now and we thought it would be a great idea to pick the ten best of all time.', 'central park movies, films, movies shot in central park, hair, portrait of jennie, home alone, serendipity, when harry met sally, enchanted, muppets take manhattan, hannah and her sisters', 0.00, 0, '', '', '', '', 'bethesda.jpg', '<a href="http://www.centralpark.com/pages/about-centralpark-com/staff/rick-anderson.html">Rick Anderson</a>', '', '', 0, '', '', 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 'Top 10 Central Park Movies', 'Top 10 Central Park Movies', 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

His father was  a doctor and apparently provided a comfortable living for his family. Vaux  attended a private primary school until he was nine and then began architectural  training as an apprentice in the London office of Lewis N. Cottingham, an early  advocate of the revival of Gothic architectural styles. Vaux became a skilled  draftsman, and in 1850, a London gallery exhibition of his watercolors of  continental landscapes attracted the attention of Andrew Jackson Downing, who  had come to England to find an assistant to run a new architectural department  in his own thriving landscape gardening practice. He recruited Vaux, then  twenty-six, who seems to have welcomed the opportunity to escape the relative  rigidity and stuffiness of English society. <img src="http://www.centralpark.com/updata/Image/history/vaux.jpg" border="0" alt="" hspace="3" vspace="3" width="240" height="305" align="right" /><br /><br />During the two years that <strong>Calvert Vaux</strong> worked with  Downing in Newburgh, New York, up the Hudson from Manhattan, he devoted most of  his energy to designing "rural" house plans (thirteen of which are included in  his 1857 book, Villas and Cottages). The "rustic" style of these houses (with  pitched roofs, picturesque porches, and ornamented stone and wood work),  complemented the "rural scenery" of Downing''s broad sweeping lawns, carefully  placed specimen trees, and massed border plantings of shrubs and flowers. Vaux,  who became Downing''s partner, also helped prepare plans for more formal public  grounds at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., a project that  probably inspired an article he wrote in 1852 for the Horticulturalist in which  he called for government recognition and support of the arts. That summer  Downing drowned in a steamboat accident. Vaux carried on his mentor''s  architectural practice, working with another English architect, Frederick Clarke  Withers. He married Mary McEntee, the sister of a Hudson Valley painter, then  moved to New York City in 1856, where he became identified with the city''s  artistic community -- "the guild," as he called it. He joined the National  Academy of Design and the Century Club and in 1857 was a founding member of the  <em>American Institute of Architects</em>. <br /><br />{{ADSPACE_300_250}}<br /><br />To his advocacy of an American architecture  that personified spirited "character," Vaux brought the confident respectability  of a bourgeois English upbringing and a deep personal respect for craft and  skill. His Villas and Cottages reveals his intellectual debts to Ruskin and to  Ralph Waldo Emerson as well as to Downing. Vaux, a personally devout man, became  a liberal Unitarian. Like Ruskin''s, his appreciation of art and nature was  grounded in their moral attributes, and like Ruskin, he believed that a skilled  craftworker could express genuine artistic inspiration. But Calvert Vaux rejected  Ruskin''s pessimistic assessment of the decline of art and craft in industrial  societies and instead embraced Emerson''s optimism in the "self-reliant" capacity  of Americans to create a new and vital culture.</p>\r\n<p align="center">All text from:<br /> <br /><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><em>The Park and the  People</em></strong></span></p>\r\n<div>Courtesy of Barbara Blackmar &amp; Roy Rosenzweig<br /><a href="http://www.centralparkhistory.com/the_book/" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.centralparkhistory.com/common/images/icon_book.gif" border="0" alt="" vspace="5" width="49" height="73" /></a><br /><a href="http://www.centralparkhistory.com/the_book/" target="_blank">Click here  for<br />more info.</a><br /></div>', 'Calvert Vaux was an architect and landscape designer, one of the designers (with Frederick Law Olmsted) of New York''s Central Park.', 'calvert vaux, central park architects, frederick law olmsted, new york landscape architecture, american institute of architects', 0.00, 0, '', '', '', '', 'sheep_meadow.jpg', '<a href="http://www.centralpark.com/pages/about-centralpark-com/staff/rick-anderson.html">Rick Anderson</a>', '', '', 0, '', '', 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 'Calvert Vaux', 'Calvert Vaux', 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00');

(381, '2012-02-16', 5, 1, 15, 'Greensward Plan', '', 'history/greensward-plan', 'Greensward Plan', '<p>2008 marks 150th anniversary of the Greensward Plan.&nbsp; On October 13, 1857, just two weeks after the original park dwellers left their homes,  the Board of Commissioners of Central Park offered prizes of four hundred to  two thousand dollars for the four best proposals for "laying out the park." This  notice for the first important landscape design competition in the United States  elicited thirty-three varied proposals, which revealed the influence of English  and continental traditions of landscape design as well as more eclectic  vernacular ideas about what would make this public place appealing. But when the  commissioners opened the proposals six months later, they found one curious  entry. Plan 2 by an anonymous contestant was nothing but a pyramid. <br />Although the park commissioners themselves  expected a unified aesthetic conception of the design, their specifications  mandated a mix of facilities. They provided each competitor a copy of the  topographical map done by Egbert Viele (who had also presented an early park  design to the mayor''s consulting board), with instructions that construction  cost no more than the $1.5 million authorized by the legislature. Certain  details Viele had defined as part of his park also appeared in the board''s  specifications: four or more cross streets connecting Fifth and Eighth avenues  along the park''s two-and-one-half-mile length; a twenty- to forty-acre parade  ground (significantly reduced from Viele''s fifty acres) with "proper  arrangements for the convenience of spectators"; and three playgrounds, three to  ten acres each. Responding to suggestions from Greeley, Bennett, and other  editors, the commissioners also specified sites for an exhibition or concert  hall, a flower garden, a winter skating lake, a prominent fountain, and a  lookout tower. The requirements thus included at least one institution of  cultural uplift or practical knowledge, playgrounds for healthful exercise, and  a parade ground for the civic function of militia drills. <br />Contest entries came from both  professional and amateur designers -- from landscape gardeners familiar with the  theories and rules of their trade; from engineers who were attuned to the  topographical problems of building roads, lakes, and scenic effects; and from  general enthusiasts with ideas about landscape beauty or the kinds of amusements  that should go into a park but with limited practical experience in laying out  extensive grounds. <br /><br />Although the commissioners had hoped to  attract European experts in landscape design, all but two of the entrants who  can be identified were Americans. At least half were from New York City, with  nine proposals submitted by officers, engineers, surveyors, gardeners, or  foremen who had been hired by the new park commission during its first eight  months in office, or by its predecessor. The surviving verbal descriptions  demonstrate that the contestants recognized common problems with the park site  and, in many cases, offered similar solutions. Most entries, for example,  embraced the logic of ordering the park -- particularly the drives and lakes --  in conformity with the natural topography. <br /><br /><center style="page-break-after: always;"></center><br />Virtually all the designers recommended  that the park north of the existing receiving reservoir and the planned new one  be treated naturalistically, with scenic carriage drive and walks generally  following the contours identified by Viele. Modifying the rugged terrain  northwest of the reservoirs would be prohibitively expensive, and the territory  from 85th to 106th streets was largely inaccessible to park visitors arriving by  public transportation. Several contestants took up a theme already sounded by  the commissioners and the press and proposed that the park boundary be extended  northward from 106th to 110th Street to encompass the high point of the  northwest rocky ridge. (The suggestion was implemented in 1863.)<br /><br />The plans differed much more dramatically  in the design of the lower half of the park. Although all contestants included  the required parade ground, formal garden, major fountain, and an exhibition or  concert hall, each pursued a different approach in treatment of these features  in relation to the natural setting. Roughly two-thirds of the proposed plans  highlighted the natural landscape itself. Working primarily within the  naturalistic tradition, these plans provided relief from the city amid pastoral  scenery of artistically arranged rocks, trees, lawns, lakes, and streams. The  other one-third emphasized an artificial civic display of formal avenues,  exhibition halls, museums, fountains, statuary, and zoological or botanical  gardens, intended simultaneously to instruct and inspire their viewers in the  accomplishments of civilization.&nbsp; A cluster of proposals within each of these  dominant modes showed the influence of "popular eclecticism," some stressing the  diverting ornamentation of the natural landscape, others emphasizing the parade  and playgrounds as popular features accommodating large crowds of spectators and  participants. And one particularly ambitious plan tried to merge all these  impulses.<br />First prize went to plan 33, the "Greensward" plan, submitted by the park''s  superintendent, Frederick Law Olmsted, and the English-born architect Calvert  Vaux. This decision would later be hailed as a landmark in the history of  landscape architecture. And certainly it was. Yet accounts that emphasize its  unique genius imply that artistic judgment alone governed the selection of the  design. From the commissioners'' perspective, more than aesthetics was at stake;  politics as much as artistic merit determined just how the nation''s first and  most famous landscape park would be designed and built.<br /><br />Olmsted and Vaux  both had close ties to the Republican park commissioners. Olmsted had been  recruited by Charles Elliott in August 1857 to apply to be the park  superintendent, with the suggestion, as Olmsted later recalled, that he would be  a "Republican the Democrats could live with." Although subordinate to Chief  Engineer Viele, a Democrat neither Republicans nor reform members of his own  party could live with, Olmsted noted that some commissioners had sought to  advance his position at Viele''s expense that fall by requesting that he  (Olmsted) submit reports on drainage and planting. Calvert Vaux, who had earlier  pointed out the artistic limitations of Viele''s plan to Republican acquaintances  on the board, carried the further cachet of having been the partner of Andrew  Jackson Downing, the leading American landscape gardener of the mid-nineteenth  century. <br /><br />Empowered to select a design for Central  Park, the commissioners had looked to the cultural authority of formal landscape  design traditions and rejected the diverting eclecticism of commercial pleasure  gardens. The majority voted for a design that most immediately reflected the  tastes of those -- mostly affluent -- citizens who, like themselves, would feel  at ease in a beautiful "rural" park where they could admire the scenery and one  another. The choice of the Greensward plan reflected the preference of the  board''s Yankee Republican majority for the English naturalistic design tradition  as well as for designers they felt at ease with. The contest over Central Park''s  design did not, however, end with the decision of the commissioners.<br /><center style="page-break-after: always;"></center><br /><br />Most historians of Central Park have stressed the unique genius of one man,  Frederick Law Olmsted, allowing even his codesigner, Calvert Vaux, to recede  from view. One historian tells us that "the actual design work in the park was  functionally divided -- Vaux handled all the structures -- pavilions,  boathouses, bridges; Olmsted handled all the rest." Vaux had "deferred to  Olmsted in areas of aesthetic decision." <br /><br />The effacement of Vaux as codesigner began  as early as May 1858 when the Central Park commissioners conferred the singular  title of architect-in-chief on Olmsted, who had since September 1857 been  superintendent, and began paying Vaux a daily wage as his assistant. (Not until  January 1859 would Vaux receive the title of consulting architect). Olmsted  presented himself thereafter as Central Park''s "representative man." Yet had Olmsted worked alone, had Vaux deferred to  his partner in "areas of aesthetic decision," the Greensward plan would not have  included some of its most distinguishing features.<br /><br />The premise of the  Greensward plan was that Central Park should express an overarching aesthetic motive. In  criticizing Viele''s plan, Vaux stressed its lack of an "artistic conception"  that would give shape and coherence to the viewer''s experience. The goal of  Vaux''s entire professional career had been to arrange "useful and necessary  forms" to "suggest the pleasant ideas of harmonious proportion, fitness, and  agreeable variety to the eye." For Vaux to have accepted the unplanned and  eclectic aesthetic of commercial pleasure gardens would have meant surrendering  his judgment as an artist. Olmsted, who admired the harmonious composition of  English parks, found spontaneous manners as well as eclectic design distasteful.  The partners envisioned the future Central Park as a unified work of landscape  art. <br /><br />Even before the competition, both men had  advocated government support of culture and the arts, and they viewed a public  park as one public institution among many -- schools, museums, libraries -- that  could enhance the lives of free citizens. Central Park would be a democratic  institution by virtue of the mixing of classes within its boundaries. And the  Greensward plan itself postulated what individuals from all social backgrounds  would do there: admire the artistically composed scenery, enjoy the spectacle of  the crowd on the promenade, and engage in the wholesome exercise of driving,  riding, walking, skating, or -- for those who played cricket -- competitive  sports.<br /><br />Not all New Yorkers shared Vaux and Olmsted''s assumption that the "popular idea  of a park is a beautiful open green space." That fact became apparent in the  weeks after the award was announced. Critics for the Horticulturalist and the  Crayon (a Ruskinian art journal) heartily endorsed the selection of the  Greensward plan, but the Herald''s James Gordon Bennett found it "impossible to  make head or tail" of the winning plan and attributed its selection entirely to  politics; Frank Leslie''s Illustrated Weekly admired the winning plan but  primarily the Parade, playgrounds, Mall, and concert hall, ignoring the  naturalistic landscape effects; and even the Times, Post, and Courier and  Enquirer, which all agreed that the first prize was deserved, hoped that the  plan would be modified by "valuable hints" that appeared in some of the losing  plans. <br /><br />Although the park commissioners arranged a  public exhibition of the plans, they also attempted to preempt public discussion  of the design. A week after the awards, a committee (Andrew Green and Charles  Russell) consulted with Superintendent Olmsted and proposed three modifications:  first, thirty-foot roads with a fifteen-foot pedestrian walk on one side and a  twenty-foot bridle path running for three miles on the other to save paving  costs and to satisfy the expectations of equestrians (the Greensward plan itself  pointed to the example of the Vienna Prater and the Bois de Boulogne in  proposing sixty-foot carriage drives, flanked on either side by twenty-foot  walks); second, a cost-saving "footway" instead of the carriage entrance between  Sixth and Seventh avenues; and third, drawing the western drive deeper into the  park, thereby reducing the Parade. <br /><center style="page-break-after: always;"></center><br />In his campaign to modify the winning  plan, Commissioner Robert Dillon recruited the board''s newest member, financier  August Belmont, also a prominent Democrat. Dillon and Belmont invoked the design  tradition of artificial civic display when they announced their "dissent  entirely" from the Greensward plan''s naturalistic aesthetic. <br /><br />The two commissioners thought that the  park would be more urbane if its circulation system allowed for more intensive  use of the grounds. With Belmont''s public support, Dillon proposed the  separation of drives, walks, and rides as a "cardinal" design principle both for  practical and for aesthetic reasons. To install paths on either side of the  drives would expose pedestrians to "the distractions, noise, dust, and dangers  of horsemen and carriages." And in place of the Greensward proposal for a  equestrian path only around the reservoir, Dillon suggested a separate ride  running the length of the park "to accommodate manly and invigorating  horsemanship." <br /><br />A majority of the board rejected Dillon  and Belmont''s proposals for enhancing the park''s grandeur and endorsed Olmsted''s  rebuttal that a grand avenue would "destroy scenery at great cost" and that  "straight lines of trees or stately architecture ... belong not to parks for the  people, but to palatial gardens." <br /><br />By publishing their suggestions for  modifying the Greensward plan, Dillon and Belmont brought a wider public into  the design negotiations and recruited both the Herald and the Tribune to their  call for more ample rides and walks and the "convenience" of their separation.  Since many historians have identified the separation of ways as one of the most  praiseworthy elements of Central Park''s original design, it is worth stressing  that without Dillon and Belmont''s public protest, this feature would not have  been adopted. By the end of June, Republican commissioners successfully closed  further public debate and fixed the park''s definition as rural scenery. Then,  apparently without a formal resolution, they directed Vaux and Olmsted to rework  the circulation system into the separate ways advocated by the Democratic  commissioners and the press. <br /><br />The designers ingeniously responded to the  commissioners'' demands in such a way as to accommodate the convenience of  park goers and to give the natural landscape even greater emphasis. Not only did  they design winding rides and walks separated from the drive, they introduced  more than thirty bridges to carry the various routes over each other. In a  technique that Vaux, as architect, appears to have most fully mastered in the  later design of Brooklyn''s Prospect Park, bridges themselves became graceful  frames for landscape scenes beyond.</p>\r\n<p align="center"><span class="timelineNav">All text from:<br /> <br /><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><em>The Park and the  People</em></strong></span></span></p>\r\n<p align="center"><span class="timelineNav">Courtesy of Barbara Blackmar &amp; Roy Rosenzweig<br /><a class="timeline" href="http://www.centralparkhistory.com/the_book/" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.centralparkhistory.com/common/images/icon_book.gif" border="0" alt="" vspace="5" width="49" height="73" /><br />Click here  for<br />more info.</a> <br /></span></p>', 'CentralPark.com -  Your first stop for information on Central Park, New York City and The Central Park Zoo, 830 5th Ave. New York, NY 1002.

The Kwanzan Cherry and Yoshino Cherry are in both in bloom for tourists and residents to gaze upon, as they blend in perfectly, completing the park''s stunningly aesthetic scenery during these months.</p>\r\n<p>The Yoshino Cherry is the most popular ornamental cherry tree planted in Central Park. In mid to late April those perusing the park can expect to see the first buds of these trees typically blossoming before any other tree or flower. Before the leaves appear on the trees pale pink flowers emerge in clusters of five or six. Then as the tree''s leaves grow, they are usually a bronze color when they first develop then change to a darker green as the summer approaches. The origin of the Yoshino Cherry, which produces a hybrid cherry, is not specific. However, it is known that the first trees were brought as a gift into the U.S. from Japan in 1912. These trees, which grow up to 30 feet, are believed to be the ones along the east side of the Reservoir.</p>\r\n{{ADSPACE_300_250}}\r\n<p>In Central Park there are numerous areas populated with the Yoshino Cherry, such as the east side of the <a title="central park reservoir" href="http://www.centralpark.com/guide/attractions/reservoir.html">Reservoir</a>, Lilac Walk (northeast of Sheep Meadow), <a title="conservatory water central park" href="http://www.centralpark.com/guide/attractions/conservatory-water.html">Conservatory Water</a>, <a title="ramble central park" href="http://www.centralpark.com/guide/attractions/ramble.html">Ramble</a> (mid-Park at 72nd Street), <a title="delacorte theater central park" href="http://www.centralpark.com/guide/attractions/delacorte-theatre.html">Delacorte Theater</a> (mid-Park at 80th Street) and at the southeast edge of <a title="great lawn central park" href="http://www.centralpark.com/guide/attractions/great-lawn.html">Great Lawn</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The Kwanzan Cherry, also known as the Japanese Cherry, is an ornamental cherry tree that is most commonly found in Japan, Korea and China. This particular tree has double-petal pink flowers, which start to bloom in early May after the Yoshino Cherry. When these trees first bloom their leaves are bronze colored and then turn dark green to yellow to orange and then finally to copper in autumn. These trees are fairly small, growing to reach 25 to 30 feet, and have a wide vase-shaped spreading crown. The life span of the Kwanzan Cherry, which does not produce fruit, is 15 to 25 years.</p>\r\n<p>There are several locations where the Kwanzan Cherry resides in Central Park, including the West side of the&nbsp;<a title="central park reservoir" href="http://www.centralpark.com/guide/attractions/reservoir.html">Reservoir</a>, East Green, West of <a title="metropolitan museum of art" href="http://www.centralpark.com/guide/activities/museums/metropolitan-museum-of-art.html">Metropolitan Museum</a> at East 83rd to 84th Streets, East Drive at 74th Street, Bethesda Terrace (mid-Park at 72nd Street), across the east Drive from the <a title="loeb boathouse central park" href="http://www.centralpark.com/guide/attractions/loeb-boathouse.html">Loeb Boathouse</a> and at the Southeast corner of the Great Lawn Oval.</p>\r\n<p>There are several festivals worldwide that celebrate these types of cherry blossom trees known for their dramatic beauty.

(Raised a  Congregationalist, Olmsted avoided organized religion in later years.) He was  driven by a sense of duty but found pursuing a career for money distasteful.  Because a case of sumac poisoning weakened his eyes, Olmsted''s formal education  -- a combination of common and boarding schools -- ended when he was eighteen.  While his brother and<img src="http://www.centralpark.com/updata/Image/history/olmsted.jpg" border="0" alt="Edward Law Olmsted" hspace="4" vspace="4" width="180" height="250" align="right" /> closest friends were attending Yale, he tried a year as a  clerk in a New York dry goods house and another year at sea. Neither pursuit  proved agreeable. In the mid-1840s he prepared for what he thought would be a  suitable profession as a gentleman farmer by living and studying with several  prominent agriculturalists, among them George Geddes, whose upstate New York  farm had won the state agricultural society prize for exemplary management. When his father bought him farms first in  Connecticut and then on Staten Island, Olmsted envisioned himself as a "country  squire" with a responsibility to disseminate scientific knowledge and rural  taste. <br /><br />{{ADSPACE_300_250}}<br /><br />As a youth, <strong>Frederick Law Olmsted</strong> traveled through the  New England countryside with his father, who admired rural scenery; and as a  young gentleman farmer, he read the latest literature on art criticism  (including Ruskin''s Modern Painters), on horticulture, and on English landscape  gardening. He wrote articles for Downing''s Horticulturalist on pear and apple  farming and another on the attractions of Liverpool''s Birkenhead Park. With the  rural improvement movement at its peak, he also helped organize an agricultural  society on Staten Island for the promotion of rural tastes and scientific  agriculture. But while Olmsted learned the art of landscape appreciation and the  latest theories in rural improvement, he gained little experience in the work of  design. <br /><br />In the 1850s, Olmsted abandoned model  farming for journalism, another field in which he hoped "to take up and keep a  position as a recognized literateur, a man of influence in literary matters."  Following a trip to England, he published <em>Walks and Talks of an American Farmer</em> in England, which combined observations on the English social landscape with  sentimental invocations of "Old England for ever! -- Amen." He took several  journeys through the American South and sent a series of letters to the New York  Times that formed the basis for his three influential books on southern mores  and the economic conditions of slavery. In 1855 Olmsted became both a managing  editor of Putnam''s Magazine and a partner (again through his father''s  investment) in the publishing house of Dix and Edwards, which was publishing his  second book.&nbsp; The Dix and Edwards firm became an early casualty  of the 1857 depression. A family friend, Park Commissioner Charles Elliott,  encouraged Olmsted to apply for the post of the park superintendent, and he did  so.</p>\r\n<p align="center">All text from:<br /> <br /> <span style="font-size: small;"><strong><em>The Park and the  People</em></strong></span></p>\r\n<div>Courtesy of Barbara Blackmar &amp; Roy Rosenzweig<br /> <a href="http://www.centralparkhistory.com/the_book/" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.centralparkhistory.com/common/images/icon_book.gif" border="0" alt="" vspace="5" width="49" height="73" /></a> <br /> <a href="http://www.centralparkhistory.com/the_book/" target="_blank">Click here  for<br />more info.</a></div>', 'Frederick Law Olmsted was a landscape designer and  architect, famous for designing (together with Calvert Vaux) New York''s Central Park.', 'frederick law olmsted, central park architecture, calvert vaux, new york landscape architecture, walks and talks of an american farmer', 0.00, 0, '', '', '', '', 'sheep_meadow.jpg', '<a href="http://www.centralpark.com/pages/about-centralpark-com/staff/rick-anderson.html">Rick Anderson</a>', '', '', 0, '', '', 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 'Frederick Law Olmsted', 'Frederick Law Olmsted', 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

They weigh from 5 to 15 pounds. Pablo has no teeth but has a 16 inch tongue as wide as a pencil. It has a sticky mucus for getting those tasty termites. He can whip out his tongue over 150 times per minute while eating.<br /><br /><strong>Zoo Tamandua Habitat:</strong> A large glass window encases Pablo''s home.

They can eat up to 9000 termites a night. They have no teeth and depend on their powerful gizzard to break down their food. At CPZ Pablo eats a pasty gruel of pureed fruits, honey and he loves high protein wax worms.<br /><br /><strong>Life span:</strong> 8 to 12 years.<br /><br /><strong>Threats:&nbsp;</strong> Jaguars, Margay and large birds of prey.<br /><br /><strong>Fun Facts:</strong> The tamandua baby stays with mom for a year riding on her back. A smelly scent gives tamanduas the nickname "stinkers of the forest." The animal can spray a foul-smelling secretion said to be four times more powerful than a skunk''s! A tamandua''s stomach was found to contain more than one pound (0.45 kilograms) of ants. At 91 degrees Fahrenheit (33 degrees Celsius), tamanduas have one of the lowest body temperatures of any active land mammal.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align="center">\r\n<object width="320" height="265" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/d2YSkMQi6oA&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash">\r\n<param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" />\r\n<param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" />\r\n<param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/d2YSkMQi6oA&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" />\r\n<param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" />\r\n</object>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'CentralPark.com -  Your first stop for information on Central Park, New York City and The Central Park Zoo, 830 5th Ave. New York, NY 1002.

The Pool<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108395/" target="_blank"> </a></h2>\r\n<p>Placid waters rippling gently beneath gracefully weeping willows,<img src="http://www.centralpark.com/updata/Image/attractions/pool.jpg" border="0" alt="" hspace="3" vspace="3" width="250" height="209" align="right" /> velvety lawns stretching to the water&rsquo;s edge, a quiet moment stolen from the temporally voracious metropolis outside: the Pool offers a contemplative landscape that almost aches to be shared.  A modest picnic lunch leisurely eaten on a lazy summer afternoon with only a few dragonflies for company, the Pool can provide simple pleasures in an increasingly complex city.  It is a rare location in the park that can offer even the possibility of solitude, but this mirror-surfaced pond, with its languid curves, has private space to spare.  Perfect for a tryst, away from prying eyes and intrusive ears, the Pool can be the site of intimate idylls throughout the year.</p>\r\n<h2 class="top10title">9. <a href="/pages/attractions/wollman-rink.html" target="_blank"> Wollman Rink</a></h2>\r\n<p>It is cold. It is winter. It is New York.&nbsp; And if it is a clear night, it is hard to imagine a more romantic spot than Wollman Rink.  In fact, it is hard to picture Wollman Rink as anything but a romantic spot after watching the movie &ldquo;Serendipity.&rdquo;  Ice skating in Central Park is easily one of the most picturesque activities to be enjoyed on a winter&rsquo;s night.  Unlike the somewhat overwhelming confines of the Rockefeller Center rink, you can actually see stars at the Wollman rinks.  As you take your partner&rsquo;s hand, you can feel the cold tingle of New York''s crisp winter air, listen to the music, and take in the incomparable surroundings as you glide (gracefully or not so) around the rink.  A romantic huddle over hot chocolate forms the perfect coda for the evening.</p>\r\n<h2 class="top10title">8. <a href="/pages/attractions/conservatory-water.html" target="_blank"> Conservatory Water </a></h2>\r\n<p>With sailboats gliding by in miniature regattas, Hans Christian Andersen reading to his friend the duckling and Alice<img src="http://www.centralpark.com/updata/Image/attractions/conservatory_water.jpg" border="0" alt="" hspace="3" vspace="3" width="300" height="159" align="right" /> holding court with the Cheshire Cat, Conservatory Water offers scenic accents both romantic and literary.  Surrounded by a group of trees that survive from the original planting, the stately pond lends a sense of serenity to the urban activities being carried out a few yards away.  On the western edge, you can usually find representatives of one of New York&rsquo;s most dedicated fan clubs.  They are the birdwatchers that chronicle events in the lives of one of the Upper Eastside&rsquo;s most celebrated couples, Pale Male and Lola, a pair of red-tail hawks that nest on one of Manhattan&rsquo;s classic apartment buildings on nearby 5th Ave.  They are not the only lovebirds in the area, as the almost constant sight of couples strolling hand in hand will attest to.</p>\r\n<p><center style="page-break-after: always;"></center></p>\r\n<h2 class="top10title">7. <a href="/pages/attractions/cherry-hill.html" target="_blank">Cherry Hill</a></h2>\r\n<p>Perched above the Lake, overlooking Bow Bridge and the Ramble, Cherry Hill is at the virtual center of the park, but still manages to remain relatively serene.  Like a reclusive beauty who will only reveal herself to the dedicated suitor, scenic Cherry Hill can only be appreciated by those intrepid enough to take the short walk up the winding road that leads from Park Drive at 72nd St. At the center, you''ll find a beautiful fountain designed by Jacob Wrey Mould. It features a granite pool with a black and gilt cast-iron center construct, topped by eight round lamps and a golden spire.  It is an elegant site that bespeaks a gentler, more refined era.  A place where it would not seem at all strange find a Hansom carriage parked, awaiting you and your paramour for a leisurely journey, the long way home.</p>\r\n<h2 class="top10title">6. <a href="/pages/attractions/shakespeare-garden.html" target="_blank"> Shakespeare Garden</a></h2>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Away before me to sweet beds of flowers. <br />Love-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers.&rdquo;  <br />- <em>Count Orsino in Twelfth Night, Act I, Scene I </em><br />A fitting quote to introduce our next pick, one of Central Park&rsquo;s hidden gems: the Shakespeare Garden. Nestled between Belvedere Castle and The Swedish Cottage, the Shakespeare Garden first came into existence in 1913. Known as the Garden of the Heart, it was patterned after Victorian era rock gardens. Then, in 1916, to celebrate the tercentennial of Shakespeare''s death, it <img src="http://www.centralpark.com/updata/Image/attractions/shake-garden.jpg" border="0" alt="" hspace="3" vspace="3" width="250" height="221" align="right" />was rechristened in honor of the Bard and only plants mentioned in his plays were planted there. These include columbine, primrose, wormwood, quince, lark''s heel, rue, eglantine, flax and cowslip, many of which sound as if they would be right at home boiling and bubbling in a cauldron.  It is in the spring and early summer that the garden comes into its own, bursting with blooms and fragrant blossoms.  The Shakespeare Garden also offers a variety of secluded rustic benches, perfect for the timeless art of canoodling.</p>\r\n<h2 class="top10title">5. <a href="/pages/attractions/conservatory-garden.html" target="_blank"> Conservatory Garden </a></h2>\r\n<p>A tranquil oasis at the north end of the park, the Conservatory Garden offers dozens of fragrantly secluded corners and lush, leafy bowers to host an intimate tryst.  The garden is divided into three sections: the English, Italian, and French. Each offers its own unique charm to the fragrant art of floricultural seduction.  The French, or North Garden, is arranged concentrically around the Untermayer Fountain, whose pool is graced by Three Dancing Maidens, a beautiful statue executed in bronze by Walter Schott.  The Italian, or Central Garden, features a beautiful lawn leading up to a lovely fountain.  Above the fountain, there is a gorgeous wrought iron arbor that is grown over with Chinese Wisteria; it&rsquo;s a lovely place for an out of the way stroll.  The southernmost English Garden is probably the most popular of the three.  Featuring beds of seasonally blooming flowers, it is always in season and at its center is a peaceful little pool that features the statue of a boy and girl.  It is inspired by &ldquo;The Secret Garden&rdquo; by Frances Hodgson Burnett, and was sculpted by Bessie Potter Vonnoh.  The pool is covered with lily pads by mid-summer and the fragrant magnolia tree that stands nearby offers ample shade for a moment&rsquo;s respite, and, perhaps, a few whispered phrases tickling your partner&rsquo;s ear.</p>\r\n<p><center style="page-break-after: always;"></center></p>\r\n<h2 class="top10title">4. <a href="/pages/attractions/loeb-boathouse.html" target="_blank">The Boathouse Restaurant</a></h2>\r\n<p>The Boathouse Restaurant looks south out over the Lake and past Bow Bridge, offering one of the most beautifully pastoral vistas in the park.  Dozens of tables all offer spectacular views of Bethesda Terrace as well, with the beautiful Angel of the Waters statue center stage on the Fountain.  Whether it&rsquo;s a balmy summer evening or a brisk fall afternoon, there is no better place to share a sunset in Central Park.  The restaurant offers more than just scenery, too.  With an accomplished and imaginative kitchen and professional floor staff, the restaurant offers a gastronomical experience to equal that of any of New York&rsquo;s finer restaurants.  Add to that the incomparable panoramic view of the heart of Central Park, and you have the perfect recipe for an evening of romantic bliss.</p>\r\n<h2 class="top10title">3. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104431/" target="_blank"> Belvedere Castle<img src="http://www.centralpark.com/updata/Image/attractions/belvedere1.jpg" border="0" alt="" hspace="3" vspace="3" width="200" height="258" align="right" /> </a></h2>\r\n<p>A storybook setting framed against the cosmopolitan skyline, Belvedere Castle offers a charming juxtaposition between urban architecture and medieval artifact.  It also provides a magically romantic backdrop for a shared moment between lovers.  Strolling along the parapets evokes images of errant knights and ladies in waiting, of a time when suitors declared their devotion by sonnet rather than cell phone.  The edifice gives visitors a scenic overlook to the Great Lawn and Turtle Pond directly beneath.  It is also just a few steps from the Delacorte Theater, which has also played host to its share of star-crossed romances. Of all the romantic spots in Central Park, it is Belvedere Castle that must be experienced by moonlight.  The glint of silvery light reflected off the mullioned windows, the pool shimmering below, all this and the myriad lights of the city beyond, how could even the most audacious suggestion be refused?</p>\r\n<h2 class="top10title">2. <a href="/pages/attractions/bethesda-terrace/bethesda-fountain.html" target="_blank">Bethesda Fountain </a></h2>\r\n<p>Bethesda Fountain rises majestically above the Terrace along the south shore of the Lake.  The sculpture that tops it, Angel of the Waters, was designed by Emma Stebbins in 1873 and is one of the most recognizable icons in the entire park.  It is also one of the loveliest places to share a romantic interlude.  Couples can sit by the fountain and watch the row boats, and occasional gondola, glide by on the tranquil waters of the Lake.  Directly across to the north, you can see the Boathouse Restaurant that stretches down to the water&rsquo;s edge.  It is scene that harks back to another era, the turn of the nineteenth century.  You almost expect to see a parasol held by one of the ladies strolling by.  It is one of the magical qualities of Central Park: it not only takes you away from the confines of a loud and busy city, but it also can transport you to another time.  It is here, at Bethesda Fountain, that you can imagine your love by gaslight, waiting to accompany you to dinner at Delmonico&rsquo;s.  Bowlers optional.</p>\r\n<p><center style="page-break-after: always;"></center></p>\r\n<h2 class="top10title">1. <a href="/pages/attractions/bridges-of-central-park/bow-bridge.html" target="_blank">Bow Bridge<img src="http://www.centralpark.com/updata/Image/attractions/Bow Brige.jpg" border="0" alt="" hspace="3" vspace="3" width="250" height="167" align="right" /> </a></h2>\r\n<p>Bow Bridge stretches gracefully across the Lake, connecting the carefully crafted Cherry Hill and the natural jumble of the Ramble. The bridge is one of the finest examples of the magic that resulted from the combined vision of Calvert Vaux and Jacob Wrey Mould. It is one of the most popular and best known spots to meet, and has hosted numerous tender moments, both on and off the big screen. In fact, if you edited them together, you could probably construct an entire Woody Allen feature just from the scenes filmed on Bow Bridge (and despite rumors to the contrary, the bridge has always been very easy to work with and has nothing but admiration and respect for the celebrated director.)  It is the romantic heart of the park, stretching across the Lake and framing one of the most iconic views in New York, that of the Dakota Apartments and the west side of Manhattan.  Countless proposals have been made on the bridge, as well as hearts poured forth and troths plighted. It is, especially at sunset, the most romantic spot in Central Park.</p>', 'CentralPark.com -  Your first stop for information on Central Park, New York City and The Central Park Zoo, 830 5th Ave. New York, NY 1002.

Lemurs are the most primitive of primates, called prosimian (before apes). The Ruffed lemur is the largest of the true lemurs, measuring when full grown, four feet in length including the long tail of about two feet. The fur is long and soft, and the ears are hidden by a ruff of hair. The color pattern varies and may be different on the right and left sides of a specimen. They mark their territory by screaming and by scent. They rub leaves, branches or fruit with their palms to leave a distinctive odor. During the day the Ruffed lemur sleeps in a hollow tree curled up into a ball. They are nimble climbers, most active at dusk and during the first part of the night, when they forage for fruit. They rarely descends to the ground.</p>\r\n{{ADSPACE_300_250}}\r\n<p><strong>Zoo Lemur Habitat:</strong> They live in a wide habitat filled with trees and vines to climb around in the tropical rain forest.<br /><br /><strong>What do they eat:</strong>&nbsp; They predominantly eat vegetation such as flowers, fruit, seeds, nectar, and leaves. Lemurs have also been known to eat insects, small birds, birds'' eggs and, occasionally, small mammals. In the Zoo, they are fed monkey chow, lettuce and mixed fruit.</p>\r\n<table border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="0" align="right" bgcolor="#ffffff">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="center">\r\n<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" bgcolor="#ffffff">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="center"><img style="border: 0pt none;" title="Hanging Lemur" src="http://www.centralpark.com/updata/Image/LEMURS2.jpg" alt="Hanging Lemur" width="166" height="262" /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="right"><a href="http://www.judithwolfe.com" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><em>Judith Wolfe</em> </span></a></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="center">\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><strong>Lemur hanging round the Zoo</strong> </span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Life span:</strong> 18 years or older<br /><br /><strong>Threats:</strong> The Ruffed lemur is listed as endangered by the USDI (1980) and CITES. It is reportedly declining because of human destruction of its forest habitat, and commercial exportation. Predators include boa constrictors, eagles and the fossa. <br /><br /><strong>Fun Facts:</strong> Ruffed lemurs are quadrupedal, using al of their limbs for locomotion. They hang upside down, holding on by their feet, when feeding. Lemurs rely on their sense of smell as a way of communicating with other animals. They have special scent glands on their wrists and bottoms that leave scent trails on branches to mark their territories. A lemur''s soft, broad fingers and toes have flat nails that allow it to grip objects and groom one another. A female lemur carries her newborn in her mouth until the baby is able to cling to the fur on mother''s stomach or back. By five weeks of age the young can climb to the tops of trees. Weaning occurs at around 135 days. Females may become pregnant when 20 months old. Lemurs fill an important ecological role of Madagascar. These primates often feed on an assortment of seasonal fruits and as they travel throughout their environment, they disperse undigested seeds in their manure within 2-3 hours. The seeds soon sprout to replenish the vegetation that sustains Madagascar''s unique inhabitants.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align="center">\r\n<object width="320" height="265" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/aF40eEJzqK8&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash">\r\n<param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" />\r\n<param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" />\r\n<param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/aF40eEJzqK8&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" />\r\n<param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" />\r\n</object>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'Zoo collection has seven lemurs, including the father and two sets of triplets.

It also has golden fur on part of its tail, hands, feet, and forearms. Males and females are about the same size and weight. They have claw-like nails instead of flat nails as seen in humans and other primates, and the tendency to give birth to twins. <br /><br /><strong>Zoo Habitat: </strong>Their enclosure has lots of space for climbing, hiding and foraging. They also have a private next box to take grooming breaks.<br /><br /><strong>What do they eat:</strong>&nbsp; Golden-headed lion tamarins are primarily frugivrous and over 70% of their diet is made up of ripe fruits. They also eat animal prey, such as insects and small vertebrates, nectars, and occasionally they are seen eating flowers.

There are only about 200 golden-headed lion tamarins in the wild.<br /><br /><strong>Fun Facts:</strong> They live in family groups started by a mated pair and numbering up to eight animals. Lion tamarins are active for about nine to 12 hours per day, starting their day between 5:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. They utilize tree cavities as sleeping sites and the entire group sleeps and leaves the nest site together in the morning. Tamarins often express their friendship for each other by sitting in a huddle and grooming one another. They produce a range of calls ticks, clucks and whines that are used to communicate with other group members and from time to time with neighbouring groups.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'The Central Park Zoo is home to the Black lion tamarin, the Cotton-top tamarin, the Red-handed tamarin, and the Silvery marmoset', 'Central Park, NYC, New York City, weekend, weekend actvities, weekend family programs, Tamarins, Central Park Zoo', 0.00, 0, '<script type=''text/javascript''><!--//<![CDATA[\r\n   var m3_u = (location.protocol==''https:''?''https://ads.centralpark.com/www/delivery/ajs.php'':''http://ads.centralpark.com/www/delivery/ajs.php'');\r\n   var m3_r = Math.floor(Math.random()*99999999999);\r\n   if (!document.MAX_used) document.MAX_used = '','';\r\n   document.write ("<scr"+"ipt type=''text/javascript'' src=''"+m3_u);\r\n   document.write ("?zoneid=20&amp;blockcampaign=1");\r\n   document.write (''&amp;cb='' + m3_r);\r\n   if (document.MAX_used != '','') document.write ("&amp;exclude=" + document.MAX_used);\r\n   document.write ("&amp;loc=" + escape(window.location));\r\n   if (document.referrer) document.write ("&amp;referer=" + escape(document.referrer));\r\n   if (document.context) document.write ("&context=" + escape(document.context));\r\n   if (document.mmm_fo) document.write ("&amp;mmm_fo=1");\r\n   document.write ("''></scr"+"ipt>");\r\n//]]>--></script><noscript><a href=''http://ads.centralpark.com/www/delivery/ck.php?n=af4bb96a&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE'' target=''_blank''><img src=''http://ads.centralpark.com/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=20&n=af4bb96a'' border=''0'' alt='''' /></a></noscript>', '', '', '', 'sea_lions.jpg', '<a href="http://www.centralpark.com/pages/about-centralpark-com/staff/rick-anderson.html">Rick Anderson</a>', '', '', 0, '', '', 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 'Golden Lion-Headed Tamarin', 'Golden Lion-Headed Tamarin', 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

These New World monkeys&nbsp; are small-bodied and easily recognized by the characteristic fan of long, white hair on their heads. They have very fine hair on their black-skinned faces such that their faces appear naked. <br /><br /><strong>Zoo Habitat:</strong> Their enclosure is windowed and heated in the winter and screened in the summer. In the summertime you can easily hear their vocalizations. <br /><br /><strong>What do they eat:</strong>&nbsp; In the wild they eat fruit, vegetation, tree sap, insects, small lizards, and eggs. CPZ feeds them a primate diet and fruits,&nbsp; vegetables, monkey biscuits, meal worms and marmoset diet.</p>\r\n{{ADSPACE_300_250}}\r\n<p><strong>Life span:</strong> Cotton-top tamarins live for an average of 13.5 years, but the oldest recorded cotton-top tamarin lived to be 24 years old in captivity<br /><br /><strong>Threats:</strong> The Cotton Top Tamarin is one of the most endangered primates in the world. In 1973 the species was declared endangered and importation was banned. Today the population is continually threatened by forest destruction to provide land for agricultural purposes and timber for fuel and housing. They are also threatened by the increase in the local pet trade. <br /><br /><strong>Fun Facts: </strong>The typical daily routine of cotton-tops involves an alternating pattern of foraging, resting, and traveling. They sleep in a group and start their day about an hour and 20 minutes after dawn when the entire party leaves the sleeping tree at the same time. Cotton Top Tamarins generally live in groups of 2-12 individuals in the wild. Most captive and wild groups appear to be monogamous, with only one reproductively active male and female, exceptions to this trend have been found in wild populations. Only one female gives birth, while the other adult females in the group are reproductively suppressed. In captivity, females can give birth to twins every 28 weeks; in the wild, babies are born once a year. Everyone in the group helps care for the young. Fathers, brothers and sisters are all observed carrying infants on their back.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'The Central Park Zoo is home to the Black lion tamarin, the Cotton-top tamarin, the Red-handed tamarin, and the Silvery marmoset', 'Central Park, NYC, New York City, weekend, weekend actvities, weekend family programs, Tamarins, Central Park Zoo', 0.00, 0, '', '', '', '', 'sea_lions.jpg', '<a href="http://www.centralpark.com/pages/about-centralpark-com/staff/rick-anderson.html">Rick Anderson</a>', '', '', 0, '', '', 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 'Cotton-Top Tamarin', 'Cotton-Top Tamarin', 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Some Silvery Marmosets may never leave the trees their entire lives, and if some do it is only because of a rare circumstance or to escape to another tree. Silvery Marmosets are diurnal and arboreal, using their claws to climb trees. The gestation period of the Silvery Marmoset is about 4-5 months and the mother will usually give birth to two, but sometimes three, young. When they are small, the entire colony will help in raising the young; however in six months the young are weaned and will mature until they are two years of age.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align="center">\r\n<object width="320" height="265" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/vV_eywCBghU&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash">\r\n<param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" />\r\n<param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" />\r\n<param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/vV_eywCBghU&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" />\r\n<param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" />\r\n</object>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'The Central Park Zoo is home to the Black lion tamarin, the Cotton-top tamarin, the Red-handed tamarin, and the Silvery marmoset', 'Central Park, NYC, New York City, weekend, weekend actvities, weekend family programs, Tamarins, Central Park Zoo', 0.00, 0, '', '', '', '', 'sea_lions.jpg', '<a href="http://www.centralpark.com/pages/about-centralpark-com/staff/rick-anderson.html">Rick Anderson</a>', '', '', 0, '', '', 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 'Silvery Marmoset', 'Silvery Marmoset', 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00');

This plush coat is colored to blend in with the snowy, rocky surroundings: gray and white with black spots. They have a well-developed chest, short forelimbs, and a three-foot-long tail that helps them keep their balance. Snow leopards stand about two feet tall. Males weigh up to 120 pounds, while females are somewhat smaller, weighing up to 90 pounds. They have a relatively small head with a short, broad nose that has a large nasal cavity that passes cold air through and warms it. Huge paws have fur on the bottom that protects and cushions their feet for walking, climbing, and jumping. The furry paws also give the cat great traction on snow. Short, well-developed front legs and chest muscles help with balance when climbing. The snow leopard''s incredibly long and beautiful tail also helps with balance and is sometimes as long as the cat''s body. Smoky gray and blurred black markings provide the snow leopard with superb camouflage in the mountains.         \r\n<table border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="0" align="right" bgcolor="#ffffff">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="center">\r\n<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="right" bgcolor="#ffffff">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="center"><img style="border: 0pt none;" title="Snow Leopard full body" src="http://www.centralpark.com/updata/Image/snowleopard.jpg" alt="Snow Leopard full body" width="173" height="131" /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="right"><a href="http://www.judithwolfe.com" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><em>Judith Wolfe</em> </span></a></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align="center">\r\n<p align="left"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Snow Leopard full body</strong> </span></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<br /><br /><strong>What do they eat:</strong>&nbsp; Their favored prey are blue sheep and ibex (wild goats), but they also feed on domestic animals such as horses. Some of these animals are bigger than the snow leopards themselves. In fact, these cats can bring down prey three times their weight. Though large animals make up most of their diet, snow leopards also hunt smaller prey, including marmots, hares, and birds.<br /><br /><strong>Life span:</strong> 15-18 years<br /><br /><strong>Threats:</strong> Endangered. It''s been estimated that the wild population numbers only 4,500 to 7,500 animals. They are hunted for their coats as well as their bones, which are ground up and used in traditional Chinese medicine. They compete for food with people, who often kill snow leopard''s favored prey. And when the cats turn to domestic livestock for food, they''re often shot by ranchers.<br /><br /><strong>Fun Facts:</strong> This beautiful cat is able to leap 50 feet horizontally and jump 20 feet vertically! Snow leopards are solitary, spending most of their time alone. The only exceptions are moms caring for their dependent offspring, and males and females pairing up for mating season. The snow leopard does not roar, rather it meows and purrs. Their vocal tract lacks the thick pad of elastic tissue that enables other cats to roar. A snow leopard''s eye color -- pale green or gray -- is very unusual for cats. A nickname for the snow leopard is "Ounce". The snow leopard is the only animal that&rsquo;s Latin name is two of the same words. The snow leopards&rsquo; teeth are over four inches long.</p>\r\n{{ADSPACE_300_250}}', 'CentralPark.com -  Your first stop for information on Central Park, New York City and The Central Park Zoo, 830 5th Ave. New York, NY 1002.

Lilac Walk</strong></p>\r\n<p><img style="margin: 2px 3px; float: right;" src="http://www.centralpark.com/usr/media/gardens/flower.french-lilac.jpg" alt="" />One of the lesser known delights of Central Park is a pathway that runs along the north side of the Sheep Meadow to Mineral Springs refreshment stand. &nbsp;It is the called the Lilac Walk &nbsp;and it is home to more than twenty varieties of purple, pink and white lilac blossoms from around the world. &nbsp;The selections includes the Dutch Syringa vulgaris as well as the Southeast European and American varieties. Hybrids from the United States and France have also been planted and all are skillfully and creatively presented by skilled gardeners to the delight of all who walk along this path. There are even varieties from Canada and China.&nbsp; When these lilacs blossom, their intense fragrance is quite demanding and few who pass this way can ignore the theater of aroma that envelops them.&nbsp; Created in 1970, the Lilac Walk was conceived and financed by philanthropist Nell Singer.&nbsp; It is bordered on the south by a fence which features the crawling vines of clematis and morning.&nbsp; By late spring the fragrance exuded by the purple, pink and white blossoms is almost intoxicating.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>9. West side of Reservoir</strong></p>\r\n<p><img style="margin: 2px 3px; float: left;" src="http://www.centralpark.com/updata/Image/flowers/kwnzan.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="133" />In Central Park, the Kwanzan Cherry blooms in early May, shortly after the Yoshino Cherry Trees, which are on the east side of the Reservoir.&nbsp; An ornamental cherry tree from Japan that is admired for its double-petal flowers and bright pink blossoms, it does not have the delicate appearance of the Yoshino, but it is still extremely attractive in its own strikingly colorful way.&nbsp; It also contributes a certain dramatic consistency to the scenic narrative of the Reservoir panorama.&nbsp; The cherry blossoms on the west side blossom almost immediately after the ones on the east side are gone.&nbsp; This extends the spring blooming season around the&nbsp; 106 acre body of water for another two weeks and gives visitors, especially the runners that use the surrounding track for training, almost an entire month to enjoy the spectacle of the delicately flowering trees.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>8. The Pond</strong></p>\r\n<p><img style="margin: 2px 3px; float: right;" src="http://www.centralpark.com/updata/Image/attractions/gapstow.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="140" />The Pond provides immediate relief from the hustle and bustle of the city just outside. This is due to a veritable wall of trees and shrubs, as well as the inspired landscaping of Olmsted and Vaux, which placed the pond below street level. This entrance was originally designed to handle most of the traffic into the park, and continues to do so until this day.&nbsp; In spring time it offers an even starker contrast as the park goer walks down the stairs and along the placid waters. Looking across you can see Gapstow Bridge and the surrounding shoreline, which features some of the earliest blooming seasonal arrivals. Crocuses, daffodils, foam flowers, forsythia, and tulips decorate the pathways and within seconds visitors are transported far away from Fifth Ave and Grand Army Plaza.<center style="page-break-after: always;"></center></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><img style="margin: 2px; float: right;" src="http://www.centralpark.com/updata/Image/attractions/shake-garden.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="177" />7. Shakespeare Garden</strong></p>\r\n<p>Nestled between Belvedere Castle and The Swedish Cottage the garden first came into existence in 1913. Known as the Garden of the Heart it was patterned after Victorian era rock gardens. Then, in 1916, to celebrate the tercentennial of Shakespeare''s death, it was rechristened in honor of the Bard and only plants mentioned in his plays were planted there. These include columbine, primrose, wormwood, quince, lark''s heel, rue, eglantine, flax and cowslip, many of which sound as if they would be right at home boiling and bubbling in a cauldron.&nbsp; The spring blossoming varieties to be found here include crabapple, fritillaria, grape hyacinth (muscari), magnolia, quince, and tulips.&nbsp; The Shakespeare Garden is the perfect place to while away a timeless May afternoon.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>6. Azalea Walk</strong></p>\r\n<p><img style="margin: 2px 3px; float: left;" src="http://www.centralpark.com/updata/Image/flowers/azalea.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="135" />There is another little known gem hidden in the Central Park landscape that comes to life each spring.&nbsp; It is a short walkway just south of the Eaglevale Arch that features a delicate display of azaleas&nbsp;and rhododendrons. White, pink, orange&nbsp;and rose colored azaleas adorn this&nbsp;wood-chipped path, as it winds its way&nbsp;further south ending near&nbsp;Strawberry Fields.&nbsp; Recently restored, this woodland area is&nbsp;lined with benches that are nestled amongst&nbsp;the azaleas making it a wonderful place to&nbsp;spend a quiet moment of reflection. &nbsp;Azalea varieties range from the smooth azalea with white flowers, the Delaware Valley White, the Pinkster flowers, to the Swamp Azalea, also with white flowers. The Carolina Rhododendron adds pale rose flowers to the mix, as does the aptly-named Rosebay Rhododendron.&nbsp; Other spring time blooms include daffodils, leucojums, scilla, and shadbush.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>5. East Side of Reservoir</strong></p>\r\n<p><img style="margin: 2px 3px; float: right;" src="http://www.centralpark.com/updata/Image/flowers/cherry_tree.jpg" alt="" width="120" height="205" />The Yoshino Cherry is the most common ornamental flowering cherry in Central Park and it can be found lining the east side of the Reservoir for several hundred yards.&nbsp; It is one of the first signs of spring in the park, with the flowers appearing in mid- to late-April well before any of the other flowering trees and shrubs nearby.&nbsp; There is always a magical span of a few days during which you can find the surrounding ground blanketed with pale pink flowers as each spring breeze brings another shower of feathery petals. &nbsp;Some of the older specimens of Yoshino Cherries along the east side of the Reservoir may be the original trees presented as a gift to the United States by Japan in 1912.&nbsp; This is truly one of the most beautiful spots in the park on a balmy May afternoon.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><center style="page-break-after: always;"></center></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><img style="margin: 3px; float: left;" title="Conservatory Water" src="http://www.centralpark.com/updata/Image/attractions/conservatory_wters.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="132" />4. Conservatory Water</strong></p>\r\n<p>The area around the pond is home of some of the park''s loveliest foliage. These include Lebanon Cedars, willows, pine and beech trees. It also features the park''s largest display of spring blossoming Cherry Trees, besides the stands on either side of the reservoir. &nbsp;Other April blossoms include crabapples, daffodils, grape hyacinth (muscari), shadbush, and tulips.&nbsp; The surrounding benches are the perfect place for either a brief respite from your park sight-seeing tour or a more contemplative visit, relaxing while you watch the tiny white sails of model boats tacking against the breeze. &nbsp;Nearby you can also find two of the Park''s most popular statues, especially with children. At the northern end is the sculpture of Alice, of Wonderland fame, with all her favorite tea party playmates, and at the western edge a statue of master story teller Hans Christian Andersen.</p>\r\n<p>Conservatory Water is also the staging area for a dedicated group of bird watchers that have been tracking the life of <a href="http://www.palemale.com/" target="_blank">Pale Male</a> and his mate Lola, a pair of Hawks, that have made there home on a ledge on a nearby building.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>3. Strawberry Fields<br /></strong><img style="margin: 2px; float: right;" src="http://www.centralpark.com/updata/Image/flowers/quince.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="133" />Strawberry Fields opened on October 9, 1985, John''s 45th birthday. Every October 9th since then has seen an all day vigil of people of all ages from around the world; fans of his music and believers in his vision.&nbsp; The park was a favorite place for Lennon to take strolls with his family, with whom he lived in the Dakota Apartments, just across the street at 72nd and Central Park West.&nbsp; The gentle slope directly behind the memorial is called Rose Hill for the rambling roses in the clefts of the bedrock. The eastern slope is a woodland popular with bird-watchers. In its center is the woodland wildflower meadow filled with Ostrich and Christmas Ferns and Virginia Bluebells.&nbsp; &nbsp;In springtime it is populated with quince, scilla, shadbush and offers a beautifully secluded place to walk, just a few yards from the noisy city outside.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>2. Wisteria Pergola</strong></p>\r\n<p><img style="margin: 2px 3px; float: left;" src="http://www.centralpark.com/updata/Image/flowers/wisteria.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="133" />The Wisteria Pergola overlooks the north end of the Central Park Mall just short of 72nd Street and the Terrace Bridge. Olmsted and Vaux, the Park''s designers, were surely inspired when they placed this long latticed patio, 130 feet long by 25 feet &nbsp;wide, at this location in the Mall. &nbsp;The long crossbeams and many wooden supports are laced with wisteria vines and in the spring they bloom gloriously with delicate pale lavender flowers, which almost overwhelm the senses with their intoxicating aroma.&nbsp; Just a few yards to the east is the SummerStage concert area a performance venue used throughout the summer months.&nbsp; In the thirties it was the site of the Central Park Casino, the hottest nightclub in Central Park and the clubhouse of then Mayor Jimmy Walker.&nbsp; Though the view of the Mall is now obscured by the Bandshell it is still an enchanting place to stop for a rest or some peaceful contemplation.</p>\r\n<p><center style="page-break-after: always;"></center><img style="margin: 3px; float: right;" src="http://www.centralpark.com/updata/Image/attractions/con_garden.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="188" /></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>1. Conservatory Garden</strong></p>\r\n<p>One of the hidden wonders of Central Park is the Conservatory Garden at Fifth Avenue and 105th St.  A secluded oasis, just a few steps down from one of the City''s busiest thoroughfares; the garden offers a fragrant respite from the gasp and clatter of the urban afternoon.  The Conservatory Garden is filled with a myriad of plant life, from carefully cultivated heirloom roses to the most common of indigenous flowers, while portions of the grounds are delineated by hedges of English yew, barberry, Korean holly and the serendipitously named "Manhattan." The Garden itself is divided into three distinct sections, each representing its own specific style. These are the north (or French Garden), the Central (or Italian Garden) and the south (or English Garden). <br /> The southern garden features the English style and as such is much less formal than the other two. It is planted to be enjoyed the year round and almost every week there are new blooms to admire, but it is in the springtime that it really shines. At the center is a bronze sculpture, the Burnett Fountain, depicting a young boy and girl. Based on characters from The Secret Garden, by Frances Hodgson Burnett the fountain was designed and constructed in 1936 by Bessie Potter Vonnoh. It is surrounded by a reflecting pool upon which float hundreds of water lilies and in which swim dozens of extremely sophisticated goldfish (don''t forget the address).  The surrounding spring blooms include brunnera, cornelian cherrys, crabapples, daffodils, forsythia, grape hyacinth, korean spice, magnolias, pansies, quince, summer snowflakes, tulips, virginia bluebells and witchhazel. It is this amazing diversity of flowers, along with the secluded tranquility of the grounds themselves that makes Conservatory Garden the very best place in Central Park to enjoy the blossoming splendor of springtime.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'Presenting our picks for the very best places in the park to view this amazing floral display', 'top 10, top ten, flowers, flower spots, park flowers, central park flowers, floral, scenery, spring', 0.00, 0, '', '', '', '', 'conservatory-garden.jpg', '<A HREF="http://andrewprokos.com/photos/new-york/central-park/">Andrew Prokos</a>', '', '', 0, '', '', 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 'Top 10 Spring Flower Spots', 'Top 10 Spring Flower Spots', 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Wintering grounds include lower elevations of the Qinghai-Tibet and Yunnan-Guizhou Plateaus in China, with some birds occurring in Bhutan and Arunachal Pradesh.<br /><br /><strong>See Them at the Central Park Zoo:</strong> In the temperate zone next to the red pandas.<br /><br /><strong>Description:</strong> Adults have nearly bare red crowns and lores (area between eye and bill) that are sparsely covered by black hairlike feathers. The rest of the head and the upper part of the neck are black, except for a small white or light gray spot extending backward from the rear and lower edges of each eye. The body is ashy gray, becoming almost whitish on the underparts. The tail is black, and the upper tail coverts are grayish. The primaries and secondaries are black. Eyes are yellow, legs and toes are black. Males and females are virtually indistinguishable, although males tend to be slightly larger in size.<br /><br /><strong>What do they eat:</strong>&nbsp; All cranes are omnivorous. Black-necked Cranes forage on plant roots and tubers, insects, snails, shrimp, fish, frogs, lizards, voles, and waste grains.<br /><br /><strong>Life span:</strong> Can live to be 30 years in the wild. Only about 6,000 left in the wild.<br /><br /><strong>Threats:</strong> Loss and degradation of habitat are the main threats facing the Black-necked Cranes. The problems are the most serious in the wintering areas, where wetlands are extensively affected human activity including irrigation, dam construction, draining, and grazing pressure. In Tibet, widespread changes in traditional agricultural practices have reduced the availability of waste barley and spring wheat.<br /><br /><strong>Fun Facts:</strong> Black-necked Cranes, the alpine crane, were the last species of crane discovered and described by ornithologists (1876), due to the remoteness of their range. It is also known as the Tibetan Crane.&nbsp; Local religious beliefs protect the black-necked cranes. They are regarded as supernatural and are featured in religious temples and art.</p>', 'CentralPark.com -  Your first stop for information on Central Park, New York City and The Central Park Zoo, 830 5th Ave. New York, NY 1002.

Preferred habitats include lakes, ponds, saltwater bays, and estuaries.&nbsp; You can see them in Central Park too.<br /><br /><strong>See Them at the Central Park Zoo:</strong> In the Penguin House with the Tufted Puffins<br /><br /><strong>Description:</strong> Buffleheads are small black and white diving ducks with small gray bills. They have a white patch on the side of their round heads and have white patches on their wings that are visible during flight. Buffleheads have dark brown eyes. They only weigh an average of 272-635 g (9.6-22.42 ounces) and are about 32-40 cm (13-16 in) in length.&nbsp; Male and female buffleheads look very distinct with males having dark heads with a white cap behind its eyes, a black back, and white sides. Females look darker and duller by comparison with brown heads and bodies and with a smaller white patch behind their eyes. Bufflehead males also change their plumage depending on the season (whether breeding or not).</p>\r\n{{ADSPACE_300_250}}\r\n<p><strong>What do they eat:</strong>&nbsp; Buffleheads forage underwater by diving in open shallow waters whose depth is usually less than 3 meters. They are omnivorous and feed mostly on aquatic invertebrates, insects, crustaceans, and plants. They also sometimes eat small fish and fish eggs. In winter buffleheads eat during the day and at night.<br /><br /><strong>Life span:</strong> About 13 years.<br /><br /><strong>Threats:</strong> Habitat loss<br /><br /><strong>Fun Facts:</strong> Buffleheads are the smallest diving ducks in North America. Due to their small body mass, buffleheads can achieve flight faster than other diving ducks. They take flight by running on water.&nbsp; Buffleheads like to nest in tree cavities and in nest boxes. They usually use tree holes made by northern flickers and pileated woodpeckers.&nbsp; Nests made by buffleheads are lined with downy feathers that come from the chest of the female bufflehead. The female bufflehead uses the same nest site every year.&nbsp; They are usually monogamous.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'CentralPark.com -  Your first stop for information on Central Park, New York City and The Central Park Zoo, 830 5th Ave. New York, NY 10021.

One notable example of this was the Maurizio Cattelan retrospective hosted in 2011, in which lifelike and stuffed animals were suspended from the ceiling at all levels of the museum. This somewhat controversial artist is typical of the Guggenheim, which focuses on works from the 20th and 21st centuries. However, there are also some paintings from earlier eras that help make up part of the permanent collection. The Guggenheim collection predates its current building, and many works were acquired as far back as the 1930s when Solomon Guggenheim hosted the museum in his apartment.

Its delicate pink bloom and startling orange center stand out when it blooms in the early summer and throughout the fall. Unlike other types of anemones, the Japanese anemone is fairly tall. The thin, wiry stems of this plant can grow up to 3 feet off the ground. This strong and persistent plant can survive in a variety of conditions, so it is remarkable both for its beauty and its hardiness. The Japanese anemone, whose name means daughter of the wind, is part of Ranunculacaeae family. When it appears in Central Park, it is a sure sign that fall is on the way.</dd> <dt id="astilbe"><strong>Astilbe</strong></dt> <dd>Some 18 species make up the astilbe segment of the Saxifragaceae family, some of which are known as false spirea or false goat''s beard. Astilbe plants can grow in many climates and soil conditions, though they are most common in Asia and North America. They can bloom as early as June or as late as September. This quality, in particular, makes them popular in the Conservatory Garden. You can enjoy the beauty of the astilbe plant in Central Park throughout the gardening season. These plants are visually distinctive because their large leaves resemble ferns, while the flowering portions are full of dense blooms. Astilbe colors range from deep fuchsia to red to white.</dd> <dt id="coneflowers"><strong>Coneflowers</strong></dt> <dd>The Conservatory Garden in Central Park is home to two types of coneflowers. The Rudbeckia, sometimes called black-eyed Susans, are distinctive for their dark brown centers and bright yellow petals. Echinacea flowers can also be found in the Conservatory Garden. These flowers can be spotted by their purple petals and dark brown centers. Though the health benefits of echinacea are well known, the Park does not permit guests to pick them. Coneflowers are part of the Asteraceae, or daisy, family. They''re called coneflowers because when they bloom, their petals droop downward. Coneflowers typically bloom throughout the summer, making them an important part of the Conservatory Garden''s landscape in July and August.</dd> <dt id="cornelian-cherry"><strong>Cornelian Cherry</strong></dt> <dd>The Cornelian cherry is sometimes known as the European cornel. It is a member of the Cornaceae family. Like many plants that are part of the Conservatory Garden, the Cornelian cherry is a hardy plant that can grow in many different types of environments. Unlike other trees, the Cornelian cherry is able to survive frosts that can occur even in the early spring. This tree grows up to 20 feet tall and displays small yellow blooms beginning in March. By summer, small red berries are visible. These trees can survive even in partial shade, making them ideal to give height and color to the Conservatory Garden even when other plants are not yet in bloom.</dd> <dt id="flowering-crabapple"><strong>Flowering Crabapple</strong></dt> <dd>The flowering crabapple is a member of the Malus family. It is distinctive because of its firm red fruits and delicate flowers, which range in color from white to red. The small trees yield blooms in late spring and fruit from the summer into the late fall. The Conservatory Garden''s flowering crabapple trees are over 30 feet in height, and are among the oldest trees in the Garden. Though the fruits are not appropriate for human consumption, they are vital to the insects, birds, and small animals that live in the Park.</dd> <dt id="daffodil"><strong>Daffodil</strong></dt> <dd>The daffodil, sometimes called the narcissus flower, is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It grows freely in Europe, Asia, and some parts of Africa. Daffodils can range in color, and are sometimes orange, yellow, pink, or white. In Central Park''s Conservatory Garden, the most common version is the yellow daffodil. These cheerful flowers bloom in the spring. Because they are bulbous plants, they need only be fertilized to return year after year. Their brilliant colors make them one of the most popular flowers in the Conservatory Garden. Daffodils can also be found at Central Park''s Daffodil Hill.</dd> <dt id="daylily"><strong>Daylily</strong></dt> <dd>Daylilies are part of the Xanthorrhoeaceae family of flowers. These plants are popular in the Conservatory Garden because in addition to their brilliant colors, they are also very adaptable. Because they are perennials, they require relatively little maintenance to appear every year in the spring. They can grow in shade or light, and in many different types of soil. Daylilies can grow in almost any color, including purple, pink, red, yellow, and white. In the Conservatory Garden, they can be found in a stunning bold orange. Unlike other flowers in the Garden, each daylily blooms for only 24 hours. It dies at the end of the day and is replaced the next morning by a new flower.</dd> <dt id="french-lilac"><strong>French Lilac</strong></dt> <dd>The French lilac appears in the Conservatory Garden for a few weeks each spring and summer. If the weather is very dry, they will perhaps bloom for longer. Lilacs may bloom in white, blue, pink, or purple - in the Conservatory Garden they are usually a deep, rich purple. Visitors to Central Park can enjoy the sweet, fragrant smell of the French lilac. Their delicate petals clump to form large, heavy blossoms. These shrubs grow several feet tall, enabling them to give both height and hue to the Garden''s landscape. A member of the Syringa family, the lilac grows in temperate climates and has long been a favorite plant in parks and gardens.</dd> <dt id="grape-hyacinth"><strong>Grape Hyacinth</strong></dt> <dd>The grape hyacinth is a member of the Asparagaceae group of plants, and is distinctive for its heavy, dense flowers, which resemble berries or grapes, as suggested by its name. These plants are relatively small in stature, but they pack a big impact in terms of color. Their searing blue is a beautiful offset to the many pink, white, and yellow flowers found in the Conservatory Garden. These plants grow from bulbs, making them easy to maintain from year to year. They bloom each spring, and though they only show their petals for a few weeks, they are one of the most memorable plants in the park.</dd> <dt id="ornamental-grass"><strong>Ornamental Grass</strong></dt> <dd>Ornamental grass is an important part of the Conservatory Garden''s visual appeal. The varying colors and heights of the different types of ornamental grass are used in the Garden to provide ground cover and contrast to the flowers that fill its beds. Ornamental grasses are part of the Cyperaceae, Juncacaeae, Poaceae, and Restionaceae families. Because these grasses are easy to maintain, grow even in conditions in which other plants cannot survive, and are tolerant of many seasons, they are an ideal choice to complement the daffodils, roses, lilacs, and other flowers in the garden.</dd> <dt id="babys-breath"><strong>Baby''s Breath</strong></dt> <dd>Baby''s breath is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, and is widely known for its popularity in floral bouquets and private gardens. It is a much-loved member of the Conservatory Garden collection, even though it is only in bloom a few months of the year. The delicate white flowers provide a charming counterpoint to the vibrant roses, tulips, daffodils, and lilacs that characterize the Conservatory Garden. This plant, also known as gypsophilia, grows best in direct sunlight and well-drained soil. It can be found throughout the United States in almost any variety of its 100 species. In addition to its characteristic white blooms, it can also display light pink flowers.</dd> <dt id="hellebores"><strong>Hellebores</strong></dt> <dd>Hellebores are a much-loved member of the Ranunculaceae family, which includes 20 varieties of this beautiful flower. Hellebores flowers are also called the Christmas rose and the Lenten rose. However, hellebores flowers are not roses at all. Because hellebores flowers are tolerant of cold weather and frost, they are among the first flowers to bloom each year in the Conservatory Garden, frequently appearing as early as February or March. Their large, white flowers and thick leaves make this unusual plant easy to recognize. These flowers are common throughout North America and England. Preferring partial shade, well-drained soils, and temperate weather, the hellebores plant adds variety to the Conservatory Garden.</dd> <dt id="hollyhocks"><strong>Hollyhocks</strong></dt> <dd>Hollyhocks, sometimes called alcaea, are a member of the Malvaceae family of flowers. This perennial can be found throughout Europe, Asia, parts of Africa, and the United States. They are most vibrant in the spring, summer, and fall, making them one of the longest blooming flowers in the Conservatory Garden. Bloom colors typically include purple, pink, orange, yellow, and white. They require full sun and well-drained soil to strive. In the Conservatory Garden, hollyhocks are a vibrant fuchsia and can be recognized by their large, full petals. Because they grow as high as 60 inches tall, they are among the most prominent of the Garden''s flowers.</dd> <dt id="iris"><strong>Iris</strong></dt> <dd>Irises are members of the Iridaceae family of flowers. The unique shape of this distinctive flower''s petals makes it easy to recognize even among the Conservatory Garden''s many stately blooms. Blooming throughout March, April, and May, the Conservatory Garden''s irises appear in deep, rich indigoes, blues, and violets. It is also possible to find irises in yellow, white, and multicolored varieties. Irises are perennial flowers, making them relatively simple to maintain from year to year. They are popular choices for ground cover, and tend to grow well alongside other types of plants.</dd> <dt id="japanese-lilac"><strong>Japanese Lilac</strong></dt> <dd>The Japanese lilac is not a flower, but a tree. It is part of the Oleaceae family and grows up to a height of 25 feet. It resembles a bush as much as it does a tree. The blossoms of the Japanese tree lilac are usually white or cream, and it mainly blooms in late spring. It also yields dry, brown fruit that is not edible for humans, but is sometimes eaten by small animals. It is also popular for the nesting of birds. The dark color of the bark, which can be gray, brown, or purple, is a sharp contrast to the light-colored blossoms.</dd> <dt id="magnolia-soulangiana"><strong>Magnolia Soulangiana</strong></dt> <dd>The magnolia soulangiana tree is a member of the Magnoliaceae family. It is very popular throughout the United States and in England. It is a hybrid tree, and is unusually hardy and resistant to chill. Because of this, it is a popular tree in Central Park. Its leaves range in color from dark green to bronze, while its flowers can be found in pink, white, or purple. Its large blooms are characterized by lush, wide petals, which appear in April and throughout the spring, and its flowers have a mild, pleasant scent.</dd> <dt id="oakleaf-hydrangea"><strong>Oakleaf Hydrangea</strong></dt> <dd>The oakleaf hydrangea is a deciduous tree that thrives in sun or partial shade. It generally requires well-drained soil, and can grow to a height of up to 8 feet. Its thick, green, leathery leaves are large and help to keep the tree cool in warm weather. The oakleaf hydrangea is part of the Hydrangeaceae family, and thrives throughout much of the United States. Its delicate, small, white flowers have made it a popular tree in public parks as well as private gardens. This tree, which has a shrub-like appearance, is one of the largest members of the Hydrangeaceae family. It blooms throughout the spring, summer, and even into autumn.</dd> <dt id="peony"><strong>Peony</strong></dt> <dd>This appealing plant is a member of the Paeoniaceae family. These perennial flowers are distinctive because of their lush, multilayered shape. They can be found in a huge variety of colors, including cream, pink, red, coral, white, yellow, black, and ivory. Peonies can tolerate cold weather well, making them a natural addition to the Conservatory Garden. Since cold weather is a requirement to produce the peonies'' delicate blooms, they are usually most prolific after a harsh winter. In Central Park, peonies bloom most markedly in June, and continue throughout the summer and into the fall. The delicate scent of the peony makes this flower a favorite in the Park.</dd> <dt id="phlox"><strong>Phlox</strong></dt> <dd>The phlox is a tall and stately plant with an unusually short blooming season. However, its striking appearance and vibrant color are very memorable. Phlox is a member of the Polemoniaceae family and is prolific throughout North America, even in very cold regions. Phlox flowers bloom in the summer and in the fall, and may be blue, red, cream, or violet. Their fragrant blooms help them create the ethereal atmosphere of the Conservatory Garden. Phlox is particularly popular in the garden as a border for its large flower beds. This plant''s height, which can be as great as 3 feet, makes it stand out.</dd> <dt id="purple-coneflower"><strong>Purple Coneflower</strong></dt> <dd>The purple coneflower, commonly known as echinacea, is a hallmark of the Conservatory Garden. This plant is well known for its medicinal properties, but many people do not realize how extraordinarily beautiful it is. Its rich, dark plum tones make it unique among some of the pastel colors in the Garden. This plant is a member of the Asteraceae family.</dd> <dt id="rose-sharon"><strong>Rose Of Sharon</strong></dt> <dd>The rose of Sharon is part of the Malvaceae family. It is also known as the crocus or shrub Althea. The rose of Sharon traces its heritage to biblical times, and its name is derived from the Hebrew word for crocus. It is also the national flower of South Korea. It is easy to see why this flower is part of one of the most multicultural gardens in the world. The rose of Sharon is usually a light, delicate pink; it is characterized by wide, thin petals. It is prolific throughout the United States and blooms from June until September.</dd> <dt id="rose"><strong>Rose</strong></dt> <dd>The Conservatory Garden would not be complete without a selection of roses, one of the most popular flowers and America. The rose is a member of the Rosaceae family. Roses grow throughout the world, especially North America, Africa, and Europe. The rose blooms throughout the summer and into the mid fall. Many varieties of roses can be found in the Conservatory Garden, especially white, red, pink, and other vibrant colors. Roses grow on shrubs that can reach several feet tall, and are known for the prickly thorns that appear on their stems.</dd> <dt id="snowdrops"><strong>Snowdrops</strong></dt> <dd>Snowdrops stand out because they are small and slender. These members of the Amaryllidaceae family are perennials that grow from bulbs and can be found throughout the United States and Europe. The bulbs of this lovely plant are poisonous, and must not be eaten. Snowdrops are characterized by small white blossoms that droop from the end of their slender green stalks. They are among the first flowers to bloom when spring comes and last through the summer. The small, white flowers of snowdrops provide a delicate counterpoint to the bolder and brighter colors that appear throughout the Conservatory Garden.</dd> <dt id="spiraea"><strong>Spiraea</strong></dt> <dd>Spiraea is a deciduous shrub that sprouts delicate white blooms throughout April and May. This plant grows best in full sun or mild shade and prefers well-drained soil. This is a hardy plant that thrives even in cold or harsh climates, making it an excellent choice for the Conservatory Garden. The spiraea bush grows as tall as 8 feet and sometimes displays red foliage in the fall. The shrubs are common throughout Asia as well as the United States.</dd> <dt id="squill"><strong>Squill</strong></dt> <dd>The squill is a small flower that blooms perennially and is a member of the Asparagaceae family. It is prolific throughout Asia as well as Europe and the United States. It blooms throughout the spring and is notable for its slight stature and delicate bloom. This plant grows only 6 to 8 inches tall, but can still withstand cold temperatures. It is frequently used as a border plant in the Conservatory Garden, though it sometimes appears in other locations as well. Its long petals can be white, purple, pink, cream, or violet. It is sometimes called scilla.</dd> <dt id="tulip"><strong>Tulip</strong></dt> <dd>The tulip is one of the most easily recognized and most popular flowers in the United States, and is an important part of the Conservatory Garden. In fact, the Conservatory Garden is home to more than 20,000 tulips each year. At the Garden''s annual Tulip Toss, volunteers remove the tulip bulbs from the ground and transplant them to other areas of the park. Tulips, which are members of the Liliaceae family, are very easy to maintain because they are bulbous perennials. These luscious blooms are prolific throughout Europe, parts of Africa, and parts of Asia. Tulips grow in a staggering variety of colors, among them, orange, white, pink, yellow, and red.</dd> <dt id="water-lilies"><strong>Water Lilies</strong></dt> <dd>Water lilies can be found in a picturesque pool amidst the flower beds of the Conservatory Garden. Their bold, pink blooms create a brilliant contrast to the deep green leaves and dark water. Water lilies are a member of the Nymphaeaceae family. The roots of these unusual plants are embedded in the soil deep beneath the surface of the water, while their leaves and flowers float freely. Water lilies bloom throughout the summer and are one of the most interesting and unusual plants in Central Park.</dd> </dl></div>', '', 'Japanese Anemone, Astilbe, Coneflowers, Cornelian Cherry, Flowering Crabapple, Daffodil, Daylily, French Lilac, Grape Hyacinth, Ornamental Grass, Baby''s Breath, Hellebores, Hollyhocks, Iris, Japanese Lilac, Magnolia Soulangiana, Oakleaf, Hydrangea, Peony, Phlox, Purple Coneflower, Rose Of Sharon, Rose, Snowdrops, \r\nSpiraea, Squill, Tulip, Water Lilies', 0.00, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 0, '/usr/media/flowers/flowers.css', '/usr/media/flowers/flowers.js', 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 'Flowers', 'Flowers', 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Some of these areas include Harlem Meer, East Meadow, Cedar Hill and Mineral Springs.

You can watch a baseball or softball game on the North Meadow fields while you sit out. Just watch out for fly balls!

With the number of pedestrians and bikers in the park, going any faster is an accident waiting to happen.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, the park drives are only open during certain hours.

There''s the lunch scene from "When Harry Met Sally" at the Central Park Boathouse restaurant, the ice-skating scene at Wollman Rink from the romantic film "Serendipity", and also the scene of precocious Kevin from "Home Alone 2" interacting with the homeless woman who feeds the birds.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Some Famous Movie Site Attractions in Central Park</strong></p>\r\n<p>Even if it''s not likely that you&rsquo;ll be found gallavanting through the autumn landscape like one of Twyla Tharp''s dancers from the 1980s movie "Hair", there are countless other movie site attractions to experience during your time in Central Park. Here are just a few that played a part in popular movies filmed in New York City:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>&raquo; <strong><a title="Bethesda Fountain" href="http://www.centralpark.com/guide/attractions/bethesda-terrace/bethesda-fountain.html">Bethesda Fountain</a></strong> Overlooking the Lake in Central Park, the fountain is featured on the lower level of Bethesda Terrace. It was first unveiled in 1873 and was designed by Emma Stebbins, the first woman with the honor of receiving a public commission for a New York City major work of art. The angel atop the fountain is accompanied by a quartet of cherubs that represent Temperance, Purity, Peace, and Health and has been seen in movies like Stuart Little 2, Godspell, and Ransom; on television shows like Gossip Girl and Law &amp; Order; and also in the video game Grand Theft Auto IV.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>&raquo; <strong><a title="The Bandshell" href="http://www.centralpark.com/guide/attractions/bandshell.html">The Bandshell</a></strong> Its official name is the Naumburg Bandshell, and it''s been featured in movies such as Breakfast at Tiffany''s and Hair. However, the Bandshell is actually used for concerts and other stage events featuring groups like the New York Philharmonic, the Metropolitan Opera, and the Washington Square Music Festival. Good Morning America and the Today Show have both used the Bandshell to feature popular music artists as a way to boost their television ratings. Most of the events that take place at the Bandshell are free, and appeal to people of all ages.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li> <span style="background: #efefef; color: green; padding: 2px;"><span style="background: #efefef; color: green; padding: 2px;">{{ADSPACE_300_250}}</span></span>\r\n<p>&raquo; <strong><a title="The Conservatory Garden" href="http://www.centralpark.com/guide/attractions/conservatory-garden.html">The Conservatory Garden</a></strong> Of all the places in the 843 acres that make up Central Park, the Conservatory Garden is possibly the most earth-friendly. This attraction is actually made up of three smaller gardens, one each in the style of English, French, and Italian landscaping. Because the city has designated the Conservatory Garden as an official Quiet Zone, don''t be surprised if you run into a couple tying the knot or children visiting the memorial fountain that pays tribute to Frances Hodgson Burnett''s classic tale, The Secret Garden. Stuart Little also raced his boats in the pond there.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>&raquo; <strong><a title="Trump Wollman Skating Rink" href="http://www.centralpark.com/guide/attractions/wollman-rink.html">Trump Wollman Skating Rink</a></strong> While many film buffs know that iconic couples from the romantic movies Love Story and Serendipity both skated here, they''d be surprised to learn that in the summer the landmark actually transforms into the Victorian Gardens Amusement Park. As the rink''s name suggests, the Trump organization currently operates it in conjunction with a company from Virginia. The rink is an entertaining place to visit during any season, and it also offers a breathtaking view of the surrounding New York City skyline both day and night.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>&raquo; <strong><a title="Tavern on the Green" href="http://www.centralpark.com/guide/attractions/tavern-on-the-green.html">Tavern on the Green</a></strong> Most film buffs will associate this iconic Central Park landmark with movies like Ghostbusters, Edward Scissorhands, Beaches, Stella, and The Flintstones. Tavern on the Green has also been&nbsp;<span>frequented by famous artists and celebrities such as Grace Kelly and Fay Wray. John Lennon celebrated several of his birthdays at Tavern on the Green in the late 70''s, and it was the restaurant of choice for many opening night Broadway show festivities</span>. In 2009 the restaurant closed down after filing for bankruptcy, reopening again in 2010 as an information center and gift shop.

One is at the Dene and the other is at the <a title="Ramble" href="http://www.centralpark.com/guide/attractions/ramble.html">Ramble</a>. Cot Cop can be found at 60th Street in the middle of the park, not far from Central Park South. The structure is located on the top of a small hill for which it was named. Cop Cot means "little house on the crest of the hill" in Scottish.</p>\r\n<p>Cop Cot is sheltered by trees and offers a shady, semiprivate spot for viewing Central Park. Located near the <a title="Artists'' Gate central park" href="http://www.centralpark.com/guide/attractions/artist-s-gate.html">Artists'' Gate</a> at 6th Avenue and Central Park South, this quaint location is near the <a title="Hecksher Playground" href="http://www.centralpark.com/guide/attractions/heckscher-playground.html">Hecksher Playground</a>, the <a title="Victorian Gardens" href="http://www.centralpark.com/guide/attractions/victorian-gardens.html">Victorian Gardens</a>, and the Driprock Arch.</p>\r\n<p>Cop Cot is constructed of rustic dark wood that is reminiscent of the mountains in upstate New York. The interior benches are made of red cedar harvested locally. During construction, the natural appearance of the tree branches was preserved to enhance the location''s charm. Built on a rock outcropping under a canopy of trees above the park''s Center Drive, this location is peaceful and secluded. The structure is a rough hexagon that is light and airy, with an attractive roof made of dark wood arranged in concentric circles. The structure provides some protection from the elements and is a good lunch spot on dreary days. The gray and slate rocks at Cop Cot provide a rich contrast to the green trees and grass.</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0 0 20px; text-align: right;">{{ADSPACE_300_250}}</p>\r\n<p>Because of its attractive location and relative privacy, Cop Cot is a favorite wedding spot for New Yorkers. The tree canopy and sparse roof can take some of the guesswork out of outdoor wedding planning, since they do offer some protection from light rain and dreary weather. The location will host between 10 and 30 people, making it a suitable option for intimate weddings. This spot is aesthetically pleasing and requires little dressing up, but the park does permit some decorations, if desired.</p>\r\n<p>Spring is a traditional wedding season and the perfect time to take advantage of the blooming black locust trees that surround Cop Cot. Near the structure are plants like yucca and Spanish bayonet. Fall weddings offer the rich oranges, burgundies, and ochres of the changing trees. Though the air may be slightly chilly, Cop Cot''s location near the entrance to the park allows for a beautiful ceremony convenient to the Upper East Side&rsquo;s many restaurants. Though vehicles are not permitted into the park, the structure is close enough to the streets that the small amount of setup that is allowed (usually a few folding tables and minimal decorations) can be brought into the park on foot. Alcohol is not permitted anywhere in Central Park, but Cop Cot and the ground around it are suitable for a festive wedding picnic.</p>', 'Cop Cot is one of the older structures in Central Park; it is a reproduction of one of the original wooden shelters that were common in the park in the late 1860s and is the largest remaining wooden shelter in the park.', 'cop cot, wooden structure, weddings', 0.00, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 0, '', '', 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 'Cop Cot', 'Cop Cot', 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

The Pavilion''s antique-style construction, location, and beauty have made it one of the most sought-after park locations for special events, especially weddings ceremonies and photo shoots.</p>\r\n<p>The Pavilion is made from cast iron, slate, wood, and stone and is situated on The Lake at Hernshead, a rock structure that resembles the shape of a heron. The Pavilion''s floor is made from Manhattan schist coping stones that had originally been part of another Central Park structure. Coupled with the Pavilion''s lakeside location and ample roof, the stone floor makes the Pavilion a cool respite on hot summer days. Bluestone steps lead to the Pavilion from two sides &ndash; one entrance faces the lake, and the other faces the path to the Pavilion. The roof is made of gray slate and is crowned with intricate ironwork that both enhances its aesthetic appeal and discourages birds from landing there. Thick iron poles resplendent with intricate Victorian designs support the roof. The Pavilion measures approximately 9 by 15 feet and weighs about 2 tons. Its ironwork is painted gray with gold-leaf accents; the arcade frieze is light green with gray, and the railings are painted gray. When the Pavilion was restored in 1972, a concrete foundation was poured to protect the structure. The openness and airiness of the Pavilion make it ideal for gatherings and allows plenty of photo opportunities from almost any angle.</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0 0 20px; text-align: right;">{{ADSPACE_300_250}}</p>\r\n<p>The name Hernshead was coined by Olmsted and Vaux, the park''s designers. The Pavilion''s location near this promontory makes it an ideal location for viewing The Lake as well as enjoying the flowers that are planted here, which include shrubs, herbs, an aquatic flora. The Pavilion''s out-of-the-way location and Victorian-style design makes this structure a popular first-date spot. However, the Pavilion wasn''t always at Hernshead. It was built in 1871 by Jacob Wrey Mould, and it was placed at 59th Street and Eighth Avenue to serve park visitors who needed to wait for trolley service at the end of the day. People traveled from distant points in Manhattan and beyond to enjoy Central Park''s many natural amenities, but waiting in poor weather conditions was an obstacle. The creation of this and other shelters at trolley pick-up points helped make Central Park accessible to all, as it was intended to be. The Pavilion may have once included benches, though it does not have seating today.</p>\r\n<p>In the early 20th century, the Pavilion was moved to its current location at Hernshead. Before that move, the spot was home to the Ladies Cottage, a place for women who wanted to <a title="ice skate" href="http://www.centralpark.com/guide/sports/central-park-ice-skating.html">ice skate</a> on The Lake &ndash; after the move, the Pavilion served the same purpose. When the <a title="Wollman Rink" href="http://www.centralpark.com/guide/attractions/wollman-rink.html">Wollman Rink</a> was built, the Pavilion was used less, though it was restored both in 1972 and in 1984. Today, the Pavilion is a cherished location for intimate <a title="Central Park weddings" href="http://www.centralpark.com/guide/weddings/faqs.html">Central Park weddings</a> and other special events.</p>', 'The Pavilion''s antique-style construction, location, and beauty have made it one of the most sought-after park locations for special events, especially weddings ceremonies and photo shoots.', 'ladies pavilion, wedding location, ceremony, photo location', 0.00, 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 0, '', '', 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 'Ladies Pavilion', 'Ladies Pavilion', 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

This small location on the edge of <a title="The Lake" href="http://www.centralpark.com/guide/attractions/lake.html">The Lake</a> is punctuated by a rustic shelter with two wooden benches. Wagner Cove is home to trees and flowers and is adorned by mid-size slate-gray rocks. This secluded spot is ideal for a date, a relaxed lunch, or quiet contemplation. This oasis is just west of Cherry Hill and East of the 72nd Street and Central Park West entrance to the park. It is east of <a title="Strawberry Fields" href="http://www.centralpark.com/guide/attractions/strawberry-fields.html">Strawberry Fields</a> and the statues of Daniel Webster and the Falconer, as well as Bow Bridge.</p>\r\n<p>The shelter at Wagner Cove dates back to earlier years when it served as one of the many docks at which passengers could board rowboats that went to other points on The Lake.</p>\r\n<p>Wagner Cove was named after former New York City mayor Robert F. Wagner, who served in the 1950s and was known for disrupting the Tammany Hall structure, leading to a stronger city democracy. Before the spot was renamed, it was called the Cherry Hill Boat Landing.</p>\r\n<p>Located on the water and surrounded by foliage, Wagner Cove is often cooler in the summer than other parts of the park, and it is fairly private because it is only accessible from a small path on one side and the water from the other side. The cove can be accessed from Cherry Hill, where a small plaque marks the path. Fall is an especially enjoyable time to visit Wagner Cove, as the diverse autumn colors are reflected on The Lake.</p>\r\n<p style="margin: 0 0 20px; text-align: right;">{{ADSPACE_300_250}}</p>\r\n<p>Wagner Cove is a desirable Central Park wedding location. It is suitable for parties of up to 20 people and is a short distance from Central Park West. Though generally cars are not permitted in the park, it is sometimes possible to obtain permission for a petty cab drop-off at nearby <a title="Cherry Hill" href="http://www.centralpark.com/guide/attractions/cherry-hill.html">Cherry Hill</a>. Not only is Wagner Cove an elegant location for wedding photos, but the nearby Cherry Hill Fountain also offers an appealing, uniquely New York background.</p>\r\n<p>Because Wagner Cove is located at the apex of an inlet, it offers a stunning lake view simultaneously with privacy from boaters and guests across the lake. A small ceremony can be held at the cove, followed by a reception at one of the Upper West Side''s many restaurant function rooms. Alternatively, a picnic reception can be held just to the south on <a title="Sheep Meadow" href="http://www.centralpark.com/guide/attractions/sheep-meadow.html">Sheep Meadow</a>. The shelter at the cove is ideal for the couple to stand under with the officiant, while the guests can fill the larger space adjacent to it. The L-shaped path leading to the cove from Cherry Hill is perfect for a wedding procession and allows the bride to wait out of view, if desired.</p>', 'Wagner Cove is a desirable Central Park wedding location, suitable for parties of up to 20 people.

Cicadas tend to show up in the southern states in late April or May and then gradually move to the northern states in late May or early June. Once these insects emerge they are normally active for about four weeks.</span></p>\r\n<p>So why do they emerge every 17 years? &ldquo;The prevailing theory is their long life cycle helps the insects avoid acquiring a predator that specifically preys on them. Annual species of cicadas, like Tibicens, have a wasp that has evolved to prey specifically on them,&rdquo; said Dan Mozgai, a cicada enthusiast from Metuchen, N.J. and founder of the website <a href="http://www.cicadamania.com">CicadaMania.com</a>.</p>\r\n<p>To listen to the sound of Cicadas, click play below:</p>\r\n<div><iframe src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F1371756" width="100%" height="166" frameborder="no">&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;</iframe></div>\r\n<p><span>Cicadas are often mistaken as locusts, but they are in no way related to this species of grasshopper.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>These particular insects stand out because of their large bodies and the unique clicking sounds they make. The male cicadas produce these unusual noises by flexing their tymbals, which are drum-like organs located in their abdomens. Female cicadas also make a sound with the flick of their wings, but it is not as prominent as the male&rsquo;s sound.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n{{ADSPACE_300_250}}\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span>The cicadas are known for harming trees, shrubs and crops, which leaves a lot of farmers unhappy. In trees they typically do what&rsquo;s called &ldquo;flagging,&rdquo; which happens when the females lay their eggs in tree limbs. This action of &ldquo;flagging&rdquo; leaves the tree limbs scarred and the branches will eventually die and the leaves will turn brown. Large trees can host up to 1000 insects, while smaller trees hold approximately 100 at a time.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>After the egg is hatched from the tree the cicada feeds on tree fluid and when its ready falls to the ground. Once they are on the ground they dig holes and live as a nymphs underground feeding on root juice for two to 17 years, depending on the species of cicada.

By June of 1990 they were offering free concerts in local parks, and free tennis tennis lessons as well.  In 1991, they started a garden-growing program that grew into a partnership with the Department of Education.  In 1994 they took over the <a href="http://www.centralpark.com/guide/attractions/summerstage.html">SummerStage</a> events from the Central Park Conservancy, and are celebrating their 30th anniversary this year with over 100 concerts and events in all 5 boroughs. In 1996 they launched an initiative to reclaim and restore parks throughout the city in historically underserved communities.   In 1998, after spending 1.5 million dollars, they restored the <a href="http://www.centralpark.com/guide/attractions/swedish-cottage.html">Swedish Cottage Marionette Theatre</a>&nbsp;in Central Park to the delight of kids everywhere.</p>\r\n<p>Every year they sponsor the <em>It&rsquo;s My Park</em> program, which engages over 400 groups annually in hands-on service projects and events throughout the five boroughs. They also offer a program called, <a href="http://www.cityparksfoundation.org/partnerships-for-parks/" target="_blank">Partnerships for Parks</a> which is the public-private program that supports and champions a growing network of leaders caring and advocating for neighborhood parks and green spaces. They have the ability to assist people, organizations and government with the skills and tools they need to transform their green spaces into dynamic community assets.</p>\r\n<p>We who enjoy Central Park are thankful for the CPF''s involvement and input.
